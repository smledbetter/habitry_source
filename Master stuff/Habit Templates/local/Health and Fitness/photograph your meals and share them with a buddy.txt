In order to get awareness and accountability of what you’re eating, we're going to practice photograph your meals and share them with a buddy.
Why:People often find awareness and accountability critically helpful when they’re making behavior changes. This habit has both — and it’s an extension of the “Record what you eat” habit. Sharing pictures is a fun way to get praise and support for your food choices. And it’s a fun way to talk about cooking, shopping, and planning great meals.
How:You could personalize this habit by the number of meals you photograph, how many photos you take per meal, the number of friends you share the photos with, or how much time you spend on the habit.
When:Generally, this will likely happen at mealtime. So you could piggyback your habit off of when the meal hits the table, when you’re done preparing it, or at the last bite. And you could always photograph an ingredient or your empty plate and write a great comment!
