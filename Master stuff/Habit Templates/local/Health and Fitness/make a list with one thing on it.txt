In order to prioritize, we're going to practice make a list with one thing on it. Why:We all have “todo” lists, but those have a nasty habit of growing instead of shrinking. So instead, we’re going to make a list with only one item on it: The one most important thing you need to do today to improve your health and fitness.
How:By making the “one thing” really yours. The thing that you think is most important, not the thing that you think you “should” do or are “supposed” to do. You can also personalize this habit by making it the one thing you need to do to set yourself up for success. Or if you’d like something less scary, try the one thing you know you can do in less than 5 minutes.
When:Pick a habit that you already do every day, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower, and start thinking about your priorities for the day. You can set a reminder on your phone or put a post-it note on your mirror.
