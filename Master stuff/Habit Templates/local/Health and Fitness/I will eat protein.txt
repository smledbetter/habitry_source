In order to eat better, we're going to practice eat protein.
Why:Eating protein is great for losing fat while retaining muscle. This is good because muscle helps us look better, feel better, and live longer. Eating protein at each meal also helps us feel less hungry. 
How:Personalize this habit by picking how many meals you’ll aim to eat a portion of protein. For example, you could do “8 meals this week” or “all lunches” or “Monday through Friday”. To decide, ask yourself, “Am I 90-100% confident I can do this?”

Note: below are several options to give you ideas on how you can incorporate a portion of protein into your meals.

* A palm or so of lean meat (sirloin steak, 96% lean ground meat, chicken breast/thigh, salmon, cod, tilapia, haddock, shrimp, turkey, etc)
* Fist/cup or two of yoghurt/cottage cheese
* 2-3 whole eggs and some egg whites
* Can of beans or legumes plus some of the above

When:A great trigger to remember to eat protein is when you sit down to eat. If you plan your meals, you can use that as a trigger.
