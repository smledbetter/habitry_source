In order to get aware of your thoughts, we're going to practice record your self-talk.
Why:One of the most vicious saboteurs of a fat loss program can be the little voice inside your head. So start writing down what it says, when it says it, and how it makes you feel. Learning under what conditions that voice pops up might be the first step in quieting him or her down.
How:One way would be to set aside some time every day to write down what your self-talk is. For example, you could journal for 5 mins every day. And then increase the minutes you spend if you feel the need.
When:If you are going to do this habit every day, pick an event that you do every day that will remind you. For example, you could journal before going to bed every night.
