In order to get aware of what you’re eating, we're going to practice record what you eat. Why:If there is one simple, secret trick to eating better it’s knowing how much you’re eating in the first place. Keeping a food journal is not the solution to all problems, but it’s a lot easier to get to Point B when you know where Point A is.
How:The point of this habit is awareness, not change. Be as accurate as you feel comfortable being, and try to reserve judgement about your habits. Also, this is NOT a calorie counting habit. We’re playing a long game here, and the goal for now is to create a habit of awareness.
When:Choose how often you feel comfortable writing down what you eat. Is it for just one meal a day? Two? Just the snacks? Or all meals? Any amount will do. 

Choose how you’ll write down what you eat. On a paper journal? In a private blog? On a digital notepad?
