In order to feel better, we're going to practice look in the mirror and smile.
Why:Many of us look at the mirror and judge. We look up and down and notice all the things that could be better. And this just creates a vicious cycle of judging and feeling judged. So instead, try smiling! Look yourself in the eye and smile like you’ve just seen an old friend. Because you have!
How:You can do this a few times a day, or as much as you’re comfortable. You can aim for a number of times, or a number of seconds. And if you’re feeling extra brave, you can also tell yourself, “looking good!”
When:The times you look in the mirror. If you think you’ll forget, try placing a post-it note with a smiley face on your mirror.
