##Post #2: Announcing Teams

Assuming you have enough people in your group, this post announces teams to clients and explains why they are useful to them. A couple tips:

- Teams of 8-12 work best.
- We suggest providing team names. Pick something that you think you're target audience will like. We've found teams named after animals and superheroes work well. We'd love to hear what names you come up with!

Hey [Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., "Fat Loss Rockstars"]!
 
The most effective lifestyle changes happen in small, dedicated groups and to that end, we've divided you into three teams. We'll shake these teams up every habit so everyone will get a chance to support everyone else!
 
You will be checking in every night with your teams, but post whatever you want to the whole group whenever you want to. Links, tips, thoughts, struggles, anything you feel comfortable sharing. The purpose of the team is to make checking in more manageable for you, so you don't need to worry about competing or anything. So share away!
