#Motivational Interviewing
Motivational Interviewing is a way of having conversations with clients about change. By getting clients to talk about why they might want to change, we can help strengthen their motivation to change.

##Why it's important for Habitry

You can think of Habitry as group conversations about 4 things:

###1. Autonomy

Talking with clients about what they want to change and how they can take ownership of it.

###2. Competence

Talking with clients about how they are effective at getting what they want.

###3. Belonging

Talking with clients about how getting what they want will bring them closer to people they care about.

###4. Process: 

Talking with clients about how to keep moving forward, one step at a time, until they get to where they want to be.

##History
Motivational interviewing (MI) refers to a counseling approach in part developed by clinical psychologists Professor William R Miller, Ph.D. and Professor Stephen Rollnick, Ph.D. The concept of motivational interviewing evolved from experience in the treatment of problem drinkers, and was first described by Miller (1983) in an article published in Behavioural Psychotherapy.
