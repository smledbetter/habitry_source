#How do I help clients understand it’s normal to lose “only” 3 pounds a month?

##Quick Summary
Help clients to understand what a reasonable amount of fat loss is, since many clients can have unrealistic expectations from seeing fad-diet promises. Gently steer the focus away from fat loss, and try to shift their attention to what their bodies are now capable of; have them rejoice in the improvements in strength, endurance, and vitality, and the fat loss rate obsession mindset will shift.

###How to Start

1. At the beginning of the coaching relationship; set realistic goals (if fat loss is the desired outcome, have a conversation about what the typical rates of fat loss are, and explain that generally speaking, the slower the fat loss, the more sustainable the results are.)

2. Rather than setting “outcome goals” with clients, try setting “behaviour/process goals” instead. (Behaviour/process goals focus on a specific set of actions, and tasks, and do not focus on the outcome, which we cannot control.) 

3. If possible, use the power of group coaching, which will help clients to feel ‘normal’ and realize that they are not alone in their often-times slow progress. Again, try to shift the conversation away from the scale weight and appearances, to how great they are feeling as a result of doing something positive for themselves.

4. Have a few answers that are ready to go in your coaching toolbox, with explanations and answers that you can offer to clients to assuage their concerns about these questions that keep coming up.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* [Have a referral network in place with mental health professionals you know and trust] (http://habitry.com/blog/help-the-clients-we-cant-help).

* Invest in seeing a mental health professional yourself – people can be more open to being referred out when the referring coach has first hand experience with therapy.

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* Marc Halpern suggests being specific about realistic rates of fat loss at the beginning of the coaching relationship.

* Mark Young suggests, “that you shift the focus from outcome goals (i.e., weight) to process goals (actions/habits) that she needs to work on. Your body will determine the rate of results on any given plan. What you have influence over is what you specifically do. Once you master the process, the outcomes will eventually follow.” Mark also says that at times he has had to ban clients from the scale, in an effort to shift their focus to the process.

* Sarah Campbell says that she has a huge organized collection of quotes and answered organized by habit. “Often I go there for inspiration and then use new words for the client’s situation.” Another idea is to record yourself on video and send clients the link of relevant topics, which will help clients to feel more normalized, and connected to you, as their coach.

* Coach Stevo offers the power of group coaching as a means to normalize. “I’m talking about the social psychology of “normalization.” If you put all those women in a safe space and one of them said, “I only lost 3lbs this month,” then everyone in group would say, “damn right!” and everyone in the group sees it’s normal. I stopped working 1-1 and switched only to groups because normalization saves everyone time.”

* “I always thought the magic weight loss pill would be the one that made you illiterate for a period of time so you can’t read internet articles. I think spending 10 minutes with someone talking about it (reassuring what they already know) is totally normal and really where they need you.” – Marc Halpern

* “I think it’s good to remember that you’re looking to change mindsets that people have had for a REALLY long time and it’s not a switch that they can turn off and on, there will be a lot of grey area before they get to the point where they *get* what you’re teaching them. I think sometimes people simply need someone to listen to them while they work through it.” – Catherine Wohlwend

* “Use other markers. Have them measure. Have them compare photos. Have them chart relative strength.” – Dan Rollins

* “Most people I’m working with are happy to lose each and every pound, so it’s not too often anyone thinks it’s too slow. (And most of my people are losing slower than 3 lbs a month, I’m guessing.) But when it does come up, we discuss the pros and cons of speeding it up. “If you want to be hungrier more of the day and eat less than you are now, you can lose weight faster; it just means choosing more discomfort. You could speed things up by reducing the number of treats you eat; people who are doing those rapid weight loss programs wouldn’t able to have enjoyed the 2 beers and the ice cream you had last week. When I bring up the fact that they are still eating treats… it’s pretty eye opening. They come around. But I’ve offered clients to cut their treats budget down for more rapid weight loss and they rarely want to.” – Georgie Fear

* “In practice I am very cold to outcomes. I want to make it CRYSTAL CLEAR that I value process over outcome. So I say that. A LOT. If you work your ass off and push yourself all week, I don’t care if the scale doesn’t move, your weights don’t go up, or your broad jump hasn’t increased: I’m proud as fuck and you better be proud of yourself to. You can ONLY directly control the choices you make and the effort you put in. What if you were to skip your workouts, eat whatever you feel like and avoid every hard thought or conversation you could have had that week… and you lose 2 pounds. Am I proud of you? No. Did you make progress? No. Should you be proud of yourself because the scale changed? No. We are here to work and change, right? We cannot directly control our outcomes so those need to be secondary. At best. Do you agree?” – Matt Talley

* “I view my interactions with clients as a small fish tank of awesome in an ocean of shit. EVERYWHERE else they go, they have to deal with a controlling, paternalistic, outcome focused culture. So of course they are going to keep getting distracted by the outcomes. It’s only human. So we just have to keep re-focusing them on the process, in creative ways that connect with them, forever.” – Omar Ganai
