#How can I effectively attract the clients that need me?

##Quick Summary
Get clear on your values and who your target clients are. Explain to them how you can solve their problems (in their words, not yours).

###How to Start

1. Know your brand inside out. What problems do you solve? What opportunities do you create? What values do you have? What is your mission? What do you stand for?

2. Find your exact audience for your message.

3. Learn their language and their problems. When you communicate with them, talk in their language, not yours.

4. Create really killer content that has real value. Every piece of content should help them become a better version of themselves.

5. Get that message out. Start a community. Guest blog. Have guest bloggers. And if you have a funnel in place, you can even buy traffic.

6. Use feedback to refine your approach.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Write a lot about the answers to questions your target market has. Write stuff that solves their problems. Doesn’t matter if writing isn’t your strength – do podcasts, video, whatever. Find *one* channel you like, and use it to answer a lot of questions and solve a lot of problems. Establish yourself as an expert in that niche with really great content.

* Get clear in your message, get it in front of people. Those who resonate with it are the ones who become the most loyal clients who then in turn pass on that message for you.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “ If I have one piece of advice: Grind. I don’t know how many posts/podcasts/videos it will take to establish you as an expert, but I started getting results after a couple hundred blog posts, and amazing results after about a thousand blog posts. Also — at a commercial gym I did the same thing — I put on a workshop every month. Brand new trainer, just doing workshop after workshop. Many sucked. Many nobody came. Pretty soon though, I was “the trainer who did the workshops” and people assumed I knew stuff. Started getting clients from the workshops. Just teaching things and answering questions. Walked around the gym floor, making friends. Made friends with 300 people. 300 people in the gym I could tell you what mattered to them, what their goals were, and what their workout history was. People started asking me questions. Many of my new friends referred me clients.” – Josh Hillis

*  “From my own business experience things really took off once I really started voicing my brand to people. What is a brand to your clients and prospects? It’s the promise of an expectation times the emotional power of that expectation. Knowing what that is puts you on a path the attracts the clients that need you. For example my brand of “Results One Habit at a time” the expectation is obvious, getting results by doing one thing at a time. Using words from my clients who describe the emotional power of that brand they use words like: simple, clarity, not overwhelming, do-able, relief, un intimidating. Know these words I can use this information to speak to the people who are looking for a solution that is simple, and relieves you from the pain of feeling stuck, overwhelmed and intimidated to start. ” – Robin Mungall
