#How do I help clients figure out their goals?

##Quick Summary
Ask clients to describe the type of person they want to become on this journey and what that person does everyday.

###How to Start

In order to have clients connect with a goal with gravity, have clients identify with what their goals and values are –  this will have them connect to the self, which will help to drill down to figure out what really matters. 

Ask thoughtful questions about what’s important to them, and really listen and observe carefully, and then base your coaching decisions and behavior on the evidence. 

Ask clients to identify their values and goals: Who do I want to be? What do I want to be?

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Coach Stevo says, “Instead of asking “what“ people want, I ask them to “describe the person they want to become on this journey. What kind of person are they and what do they do every day?“

* Coach Stevo offers further insight by asking a client to fill out a Performance Profile: “I’d try a Performance Profile. Ask him to name the 6 or so skills/habits/qualities that he believes are necessary to meet his body-comp goals. Then self-rate them on a scale of 1-6. Map them out. Then ask him which one he wants to work on next.”

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* Coach Stevo asks his clients “What are your real goals? I start my client assessments by asking a simple, but often-hard question: ‘What do you want?’ Not ‘What have you been told to want,” not “What do you want from me,’ but ‘What do you want from you—your body, your time, your effort, and your focus?” See [Scale Got You Down? 4 Motivating Ways to Measure Progress] (http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/forget-the-scale-theres-a-better-way-to-measure-success/).

* In Coach Stevo’s “[We Only Track One] (http://habitry.com/blog/we-only-track-one)” article, he writes about the futility of taking on multiple goals at once. “Shah, Friedman, and Kruglanski (2002) showed that people with multiple goals only concentrate on one goal anyway. Gilliland and Landis (1992) showed that we tend to concentrate on whatever goal is the most clearly defined.” 

* In another article, “[Buddha on the Road] (http://habitry.com/blog/buddha-on-the-road)” Coach Stevo talks about the dichotomy of goal-setting; on the one hand, it sounds easy, but goal setting is more complex on further investigation. In this article, he delves further into the meaning of goal-setting. “It sounds silly to say, but as someone who teaches people how to set goals for a living I can tell you that most of the people I talk to do not understand the goal of a goal.”

* Samantha Attard, writes in “[Setting Better Goals] (http://http//samanthaattard.com/happyhealthyhuman/setting-better-goals/)” about being specific when goal-setting, and that being vague when goal-setting leads to poor follow through. “Want to start following through on your health goals? Start setting better goals.”
