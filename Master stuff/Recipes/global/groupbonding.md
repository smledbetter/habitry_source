#What makes a group bond?

##Quick Summary
Provide a safe, positive, and judgement free space where members with common values and goals can share experiences.

###How to Start

1. Ensure that your group (i.e. intentional community) has a well established communal goal and members have shared values.

2. Provide foundational ground rules to guarantee that the group environment is empathetic, safe, and judgement free to allow for honest and vulnerable discussion.

3. Be patient – bonding takes time. Provide a reason for people to keep showing up.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Being consistently engaged with their groups (every 1-2 days) and posing meaningful questions that relate to the common group goal to generate honest and vulnerable discussion.

* In real life, providing extra social time around food and/or drink (example kettlebells and sandwiches, or running and coffee). 

* Lead from the front – be the group member you want other members to aspire to.

* Improve accountability and cohesiveness by creating a sense of belonging for group members. For example, messaging (either privately or publicly) members that were not present at a group gathering, or that have not been engaged in recent online discussions to say that they have been missed.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “I’d say shared experiences are numero uno. Even conversations are a kind of experience. ” – Armi Legge

*  “It‘s the experience that creates a bond. This bond then creates a community because you all have something to share in.” – Robbie Farlow

* “Vulnerability is definitely a door-opener and allows for a more meaningful connection.” – Sandi Danilowitz 

* “Some of the most committed, the most engaged, and the most connected people I’ve coached didn’t participate. They bonded with the group, but the group didn’t bond with them.” – Roland Fisher
