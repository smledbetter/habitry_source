#In a situation that warrants a mental health referral, how do you tactfully facilitate that referral without making the situation worse?

##Quick Summary
Casually ask if they think seeking therapy might help improve their situation. Be empathetic, conscientious, and respectful of your clients comfort.

###How to Start

1. Refocus the client on the things they are doing well right now and the things they’re learning through the process.

2. Ensure that the timing and setting is correct to engage in this particular conversation (i.e. comfortable, safe, not rushed, private).

3. Ask them casually if they think therapy might be useful option to improve their particular situation.

4. Be empathetic. If possible, be relatable and share your own experiences with seeking outside help for personal problems.

5. You may consider explaining some positive elements about seeking help/therapy:
 * A sign of strength and personal accountability.

 * Can be useful for anyone (not just “crazy people”).

 * Can be interesting and engaging.

 * Useful tools for dealing with unique problems.

 * Creating a team of professionals can better support you in your journey.

6. If they are receptive, provide a specific referral to get additional help.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* [Have a referral network in place with mental health professionals you know and trust] (http://habitry.com/blog/help-the-clients-we-cant-help).

* Invest in seeing a mental health professional yourself – people can be more open to being referred out when the referring coach has first hand experience with therapy.

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* “I usually bring it up very casually: “Are you opposed to utilizing therapy as another tool in your journey? It’s sometimes nice to have a team of professionals to support you in the beginning.” – Jessica Owens Mauk

* “Let them know you’ve also benefited greatly from a mental health professional in the past/present and it isn’t just for “crazy” people. Whether they say it or not, they’ll probably wonder what’s wrong with them that they’re being referred out but you would never actually go see a therapist yourself.” – Matt Talley

* “I talk openly about help I’ve asked for/sought out myself. I also speak freely about life challenges and how asking for/getting help is a sign of strength.” – Alison E. Bane

* “I would want to let them know that it’s really about making sure they have all of the proper tools available to them to help them be successful. Therapists and other mental health professionals have techniques that they can teach people to help overcome anxiety, challenge ingrained beliefs, etc.” – Megan Pratt
