#How do you fix a coaching group after engagement drops?

##Quick Summary
Expect some fluctuations in group participation; there is a natural ebb when it comes to group participation. Employ some engagement strategies in order to re-engage and keep the activity going.

###How to Start

1. Reach out to the most engaged members of the group to ask them privately what they are getting out of the group, and to enquire what they would like to see more of. Ask them if they would like to take a leadership role.

2. If possible, try to keep the numbers of the group up; a 20% drop in the group’s numbers, can lead to a spiralling loss of members. Group size matters!

3. Expect some fluctuations in participation; the “Habit Hangover Effect" kicks in, and some people’s willpower dissipates, especially around week 3, 6, 7, and 9.

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* Roland Fisher says that it’s wise not to rely solely on the coach; encourage roust participation, which will encourage a strong community, and therefore have the group be more engaged. “So with our free group Georgie was very involved with the group. She set the tone/culture. As it grows Georgie can step back more and more because early members are taking the lead more and more.”

* Coach Stevo says that one of the many ways that Habitry, Co deals with a drop in engagement, is “to reach out to the most engaged members of the group privately and ask them, “what are you getting out of the group? What would you like to see more of?” Then ask them if they’d be comfortable taking a lead in doing those things. We call it the “habit of reaching out” and, just to plug ourselves for a hot second is just one of the things you can learn in our Essentials of Habit Coaching Course.

* Sean Flanagan offers that group size does matter. “When the group shrinks, it starts shrinking faster because the number of conversations decrease and people feel un-engaged.”

* Georgie Fear suggests “creating an environment where it’s safe to share and people’s words are treated like gold. I make a big effort to thank people for sharing a piece of themselves and their story, it really is a precious thing. And support their interaction with others. Sometimes I’m deliberately in there more and sometimes deliberately less to watch how it goes with less of my input.” Georgie goes on to offer, that if engagements drops, get involved, and start a discussion, add new people, new discussion, and new activity in order to revitalize the group.

* Sarah Campbell says that she noticed that when participation faded, she “sent out an email reminding them of the benefits of group interaction (you meet your goals more easily! You don’t have to have a success story! Etc.), and it seems to be working.”
