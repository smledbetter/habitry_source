#What seemingly little things make big impact in communities?

##Quick Summary

Consistently show up, be a little vulnerable, give them personal attention, and provide a convenient way for them to socialize.

###How to Start

1. Model the behavior that you want your clients to display. How can you expect your clients to show up consistently if you don’t?

2. Show your human side to clients. Let them know that you’re like them and that you aren’t perfect.

3. Give clients personal attention. Remember details from past conversations, bring up the awesome things that they did.

4. Make it easy for them to socialize. For example, if you work at a gym, provide a space to hangout and maybe even protein powder and water.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “Being myself. It sounds trite, but if I take off my coach’s hat occasionally and let them see that I’m a person who also has bad days sometimes, or has my own habits that I’m implementing, they seem to respond really well to that.” – Jessica Owens Mauk

* “Just show up. I can’t tell you how many times my clients have told me about their previous coaches/trainers that were super flaky, inconsistent, late, etc. And, frankly how high the turnover rate is in this industry, just sticking around for a while is hugely important. That alone gives them trust that you’ll be there tomorrow.” – Jean Blomo

* “Remembering past conversations with your clients. I think that that shows that you were paying attention to them.” – Bill Wade

* “Remembering stuff they’ve done. Clients feel that you actually care when you ask about things they did. I make a point of remembering or noting important events so I can bring it up in conversation.” – Darren Moroney

* “I was in a great conversation about this at Motivate SLC. The best suggestions I heard were from Chelsea McAlexander, Brian Tabor and David Dellanave: “any changes you can make to the physical environment will have huge knock-on effects. Want people to hang out after a workout? Make sure there’s a place to do that; maybe even with protein powder and water!” – Coach Stevo
