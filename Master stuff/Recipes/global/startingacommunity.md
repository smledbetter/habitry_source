#I want to start a community. How do I start?

##Quick Summary

1. Listen to what problems your clients and potential members have.

2. Make a space where it’s safe for them to talk about those problems.

3. Invite others to join.

###How to Start

All you really need is clients and a place for them to talk to each other. If you need help with those problems, we recommend the 5 steps for starting a community in Coach Stevo’s book, [We Make Communities] (habitry.com/book). 

1. Commit to showing up by making some time (start with 15 min per day).
2. Ask your current clients what problems you’re solving for them.
3. Ask yourself or your clients, “who else has these problems?”
4. Write a Community Identity Statement.
5. Write your community’s Unique Value Proposition.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

Many of the Motivate Collective who do online group coaching use private Facebook Groups as a platform, which has benefits and drawbacks. The major advantage of Facebook Groups is that as of 2015, 1.2 billion people are on Facebook, so it’s pretty likely your clients are already spending time there. The main drawbacks are that many people dislike spending time on Facebook and that Facebook was not designed with group coaching in mind. One coach likened coaching on Facebook to “teaching weightlifting in the food court at the mall.” However, if you’re just starting out, Facebook Groups is fine: it’s free and poses a low barrier to entry for your clients.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “If you don’t know where to host your community, ask them. Let them pick the medium.” – Coach Stevo

*  “Use the Facebook Groups mobile app if you hate Facebook and want to stay distraction free.” – Coach Stevo
