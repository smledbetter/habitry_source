#Should I communicate my own insecurities with clients?

##Quick Summary
Use self-disclosure if you think it will normalize something they feel. At the same time, only share your vulnerabilities if you’ve processed and overcome them. Otherwise you risk losing your clients’ trust in you.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Use your stories to teach a principle.

* Being vulnerable means talking about stuff you’ve overcome. Talking about struggles that are still unresolved is probably counterproductive for your client.

* Sharing your vulnerabilities can help clients feel safe with sharing their struggles with you.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “ I will use self-disclosure if I think it will normalize something they feel shame (or guilt) over. ” – Sean Flanagan

* “I also believe that as a leader I need to model the actions and behaviors I would like others to adopt and being open and honest especially about struggles and failures is one of them. I believe those struggles and failures is where all the growth begins and not discussing them leaves a lot of room for improvement on the table.” – Stevan Freeborn

* “Being vulnerable means talking about stuff you’ve been through and processed and overcome. Talking about messes and struggles that are still raw or unresolved is oversharing. And use story to teach a principle, normalize a situation. Not just for the sake of sharing (and you can only do that if you’ve already figured it out to some level).” – Ashley Palmer

* “Great thoughts from everyone here. I just had this come up with a client yesterday and after I told my little story he thanked me and said he was glad to know that I understand what it’s like. I think a well-timed and relevant story can really help you connect with your clients.” – Jessica Beauchemin

* “I’ll often share from other parts of my life. About how everyone has different “easy” and “hard” stuff. I think there’s a weird expectation that people should be able to “figure this stuff out on their own” So it can really work to share about coaching I’ve gotten in other parts of my life and how hard other non-fitness/food things are for me. Likewise, I’m really new/bad at gymnastics, so I can share about my journey there, that I need a coach (actually multiple coaches) ect.” – Josh Hillis
