In order to move more, we're going to practice play. 

### Why
Because it’s a fun way to get in some light physical activity. You’ll feel better, reduce stress, and recover better from your workouts (if you do anything else). What’s play? Any kind of physical activity that you find fun.

### How
You can personalize this habit by time (minutes of play) or days per week. You can also pick what you would like to do and who you would like to do it with! Some examples would be playing with your kids, setting up a game with friends (like tag!), or simply dancing around your apartment while no one is looking.

### When
Pick a habit that you already do every day, so that it reminds you to play. Or set a reminder on your phone. Put a post-it note on your TV that you have to take off in on order to watch it.
