In order to support competence, we're going to practice give affirmations.

### Why
As humans, our default tendency is to focus on the negative. As Motivators, we want to help clients feel like all the momentum in the world is on their side. A powerful way to do that is by using affirmations to get them to focus on their strengths and everything they are doing right.  

### How
For your affirmations to be accepted as genuine, you’ll want to avoid appearing like a cheerleader or patronizer. Three rules of thumb for giving authentic affirmations:

1. Try to avoid using “I”. Instead, try to start affirmations with “You”.
1. It’s better to cautious with affirmations. Undershooting your affirmations may increase the odds that your clients will agree and talk about how awesome they are.
1. Try to avoid generic praise or compliments (“That’s good/great/awesome!”). Instead, describe how their specific behaviors show their specific strengths.

### When
Besides always looking for positives to highlight in clients, it might be a good idea to figure out a trigger ahead of time for when you’ll use affirmations. That way you’ll remember to use them.

What specific situation do you want to provide an affirmation? For example, you could provide an affirmation after a client displays effort, focus, interest, motivation, persistence, ambition, skill, etc.
