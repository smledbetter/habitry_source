In order to eat better, we're going to practice add colourful vegetables to meals.

### Why
Vegetables make healthy living so much easier! They’re like magic beans for your biomarkers of health. High intake of colorful reduces your risk of heart disease and diabetes, two of the most common human ailments. Also, eating lots of colorful vegetables helps keep you satisfied when you eat, because you can feel physically full on fewer calories with vegetables than other foods. And why colorful vegetables? Because french fries don’t count!

### How
You could personalize this habit by number of days a week you want to add more vegetables, by the volume or weight of vegetables you will add to your diet, or which meals to add vegetables to. If snacks are part of your meal routine, you can substitute an existing snack with vegetables.

### When
Piggyback off of your existing food planning habit. If you already plan meals from scratch and are at ease with trying new recipes, great: find some vegetable-focused recipes you like. If you already buy vegetables at the store, buy more of them or add different kinds.
