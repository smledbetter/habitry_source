In order to eat better, we're going to practice plan dinner.

### Why
Planning one meal at a time is a great way to gradually introduce changes to your lifestyle. Now that you’ve planned breakfast in a previous habit, let’s tackle another important meal of the day: dinner. Because it so frequently involves other people and their preferences, dinner is an important meal to have a flexible strategy for.

### How
You can personalize it by deciding how many dinners a week you want to plan. Or if you tend to buy a lot of prepared foods, you can choose to pre- plan/make from scratch just one dish for the week, like a side dish, or dessert.

### When
Pick an event that happens weekly in your life. For example, you could plan your dinners for the coming week every Sunday morning with your first cup of coffee.
