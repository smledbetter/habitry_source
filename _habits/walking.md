In order to move more, we're going to practice walking. 

### Why
Walking is an easy, low stress way to increase your physical activity. Walking more will improve your cardiovascular fitness and help create a caloric deficit for fat loss. It might also give you more energy.

### How
You could start by aiming for a certain number of steps or a certain number of minutes or even a number of times a day you would like to go for a walk.

### When
Pick a time of day, such as a lunch break, or a habit that you already do every day, like when you take telephone calls, so that it reminds you to walk.

Other examples include walking when you start surfing the internet, walking when you take meetings, walking after meals, or walking during your coffee break.
