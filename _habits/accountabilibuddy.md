In order to get support, we're going to practice talk to an accountabilibuddy. 

### Why
The most effective lifestyle changes happen when you get support from people you care about.

### How
You can personalize this habit by medium: text message, Facebook, phone call, meeting in person. Or you could personalize it by the number of days you talk to your accountabilibuddy in a week.

### When
That will depend on how often and when you decide to talk to your accountabilibuddy. Pick a trigger that will remind you to initiate the talk. Some examples include after meals, before bed, when you wake up, on your way to work, or when your kids are down for a nap.
