In order to eat better, we're going to practice plan breakfast. 

### Why
Planning one meal at a time is a great way to gradually introduce changes to your lifestyle. Have one or two easy to make recipes that you have for the same breakfast, every day. Boring, yes, but it takes the thinking out of one meal. On a 3 meal schedule, you just freed up 33% of your willpower.

### How
You could personalize this habit by number of days a week you want to plan breakfast.

### When
Pick an event that happens weekly in your life. For example, you could plan your breakfasts for the coming week every Sunday morning with your first cup of coffee.
