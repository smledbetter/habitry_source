In order to cook at home more, we're going to cook something we previously bought prepared. 

### Why
Cooking for yourself is a great way to eat more healthfully. It’s common knowledge now that prepared or processed foods tend to be less nutritious than homemade food, if only because preparation and processing usually results in more sodium, sugar, and fat being added to foods.
And it’s fun to learn to cook something you already love! Becoming an expert in one of your favorite foods is a great way to build confidence about how you take care of yourself. And understanding how our favorite meals are created helps us look at them in a whole new way.

### How
Choose what to cook based on your current cooking ability. If you don’t cook much, don’t go buy a stack of cookbooks and a box of kitchen utensils. It can be as simple as buying a whole pineapple instead of the container of cut-up fruit in the grocery fridge. Or you can buy bread and cheese and make your own grilled cheese sandwich that you usually order or have someone else make for you. If you’re already an accomplished cook, great! This is an opportunity to challenge yourself.

### When
Pick something you already eat and either make it at the same time you usually eat it or make it in advance. Get the ingredients for it the next time you buy your groceries.
