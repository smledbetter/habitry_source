In order to sleep better, we're going to practice establish a sleep routine. 

### Why
sleep aids recovery

### How
go to bed at a consistent time, turn off devices before bed, or go to bed an hour earlier.

### When
set a "bedtime alarm," turn off their devices after you brush your teeth, or head to bed after a certain TV show.
