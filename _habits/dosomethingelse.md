In order to feel better, we're going to practice do something else when you usually watch TV or surf the Internet.

### Why
Spending less time with screens can benefit you in so many ways. It can make more time for physical activity or conversation, more time for reflection, reduce stress, and help you get to sleep faster at night.

### How
Start by picking another activity, like taking a walk, having a conversation with your spouse, or reading. Additionally you could personalize this habit by number of minutes you want to reduce watching TV or using the internet. It can be as little as ten seconds — for example, you can check email one fewer time at night and do air squats instead.

### When
Pick triggers that happen at the same time every day. Like when your kids get home from school, the time of your absolute favorite TV show (and don’t watch the shows before or after), or when you’re on a lunch break at work. Or simply set an alarm or calendar item to remind you.
