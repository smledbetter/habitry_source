In order to eat better, we're going to practice wait until you’re hungry.

### Why
Getting in tune with your body’s hunger signals can be an effective way to reduce snacking.

### How
You can start with specific meals. For example, don’t have lunch until you actually feel hungry. If you want to step it up, you can also start timing yourself once you feel hungry. We recommend starting by waiting 5 minutes before you eat. It is not recommended to wait more than an hour to eat after you feel hungry.

### When
If you are in tune with it, his habit will work using your body’s hunger signal. If you are worried about missing it, you might try setting a timer to go off every 3 hours on your phone, or every hour around the times you normally eat.
