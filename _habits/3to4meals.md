In order to eat better, we're going to practice eat 3-4 meals per day without snacking.

### Why
Eating 3-4 meals and eliminating snacks has a crazy way of making you feel more satisfied by the food you eat. No snacks often means bigger meals, and bigger meals will satisfy you longer. Also, fewer eating occasions per day will go a long way toward reducing the overall time you spend thinking about and planning food.

### How
A flexible rule like “three OR four meals” means that you can vary your plan based on your schedule and activity. Three meals might be too little for people who have hardly any time for lunch but a long stretch of free time in the evenings. You can personalize this habit by choosing which days of the week will be easy enough for you to change. Or if you have multiple snacks throughout the day, you can pick one daily snack to “eliminate” by eating it with your meal.

### When
A great trigger for eating a meal is hunger. Or you can time your meals based on your breaks at work or your kids’ meal times.
