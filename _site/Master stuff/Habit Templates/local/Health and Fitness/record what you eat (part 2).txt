In order to get aware of what you’re eating, we're going to practice record what you eat (part 2).
Why:This is a progression from the very first habit where you kept a food journal for two weeks. Now we’ll check in and see what has changed and whether there’s anything that could use new attention.
How:Choose how often you feel comfortable writing down what you eat. Is it for just one meal a day? Two? Just the snacks? Or all meals? Any amount will do. Choose how you’ll write down what you eat. On a paper journal? In a private blog? On a digital notepad? You won’t have to share any of your notes. They’re ONLY for you. However, we’ll ask you in the forum to reflect on how the journaling is going generally.
When:Look for an event you can use as a reminder to write down what you eat: like after finishing a meal, before your workout, before you take your contacts out at night, when an alarm goes off on your phone, whatever you want. Just pick a pre-existing habit to use as your reminder.
