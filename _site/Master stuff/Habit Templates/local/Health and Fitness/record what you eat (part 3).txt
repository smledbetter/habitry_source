In order to get aware of what you’re eating, we're going to practice record what you eat (part 3).
Why:This is a second progression from the very first habit where you kept a food journal for two weeks. This time, we’ll figure out what foods keep you satiated longer. This is useful for fat loss.
How:Note how full you feel after each meal. You may feel more full after meals that have higher percentages of protein and carbohydrates. Or you may feel more full after meals that have higher percentages of protein and fat. Or, you may feel more full after meals that have a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. The idea is just to pay attention to what kinds of meals make you feel the most full. Then later on, when we work on a food planning habit, you can deliberately plan more satiating meals.  
When:Look for an event you can use as a reminder to write down what you eat: like after finishing a meal, before your workout, before you take your contacts out at night, when an alarm goes off on your phone, whatever you want. Just pick a pre-existing habit to use as your reminder.
