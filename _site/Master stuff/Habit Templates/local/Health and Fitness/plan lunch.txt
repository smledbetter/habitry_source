In order to eat better, we're going to practice plan lunch.
Why:Planning one meal at a time is a great way to gradually introduce changes to your lifestyle. Have one or two easy to make recipes that you have for the same lunch, every day. Boring, yes, but it takes the thinking out of one meal. On a 3 meal schedule, you just freed up 33% of your willpower.
How:You could personalize this habit by number of days a week you want to plan lunch. Or if you canâ€™t control your lunches due to very limited options, you can make a smaller change based on the options you have.
When:Pick an event that happens weekly in your life. For example, you could plan your lunches for the coming week every Sunday morning with your first cup of coffee.
