In order to feel better, we're going to practice get sunshine.
Why:Getting sunshine provide Vitamin D, which is good for a variety of health reasons. It also feels good and brightens your mood. And if you have trouble sleeping (or jet lag) getting out into the sun has shown to really help.
How:You could personalize this habit by specific days or by time spent in the sun. You can also make “sunshine breaks” and try to get as many in as you feel confident you can.
When:Assuming you want to do this every day, pick an event that happens every day in your life which will remind you to get some sunshine. For example, you could get some sunshine with your morning cup of coffee or when you get sleepy in the middle of the day.
