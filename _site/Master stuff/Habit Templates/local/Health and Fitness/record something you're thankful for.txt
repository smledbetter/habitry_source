In order to feel better, we're going to practice record something youâ€™re thankful for.
Why:"The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change." - Carl Rogers. When it comes to creating effective behavior change, only one thing matters: momentum. Writing down what you are thankful for reminds you everything that you are doing right (and everyone is doing something right all of the time). And that will give you forward momentum!
How:One way would be to set aside some time every day to write down what you are thankful for. For example, you could journal for 5 mins every day. And then increase the minutes you spend if you feel the need. Another way could be to aim for a certain number of things things you are thankful for. You can also pick the format that you would like to record your journal.
When:If you are going to do this habit every day, pick an event that you do every day that will remind you. For example, you could journal before going to bed every night.
