In order to eat better, we're going to practice eat fruit instead of refined sugar. Why:Fruits are loaded with fiber and water and take time to eat. For this reason, sugar from fruit is absorbed into the body slowly. Plus, fruit is incredibly fulfilling. Most people will feel satisfied after one large apple, which contains 23 grams of sugar, 13 of which are fructose.

A single apple is likely to make you feel more full than a Coke, automatically making you eat less of other foods. However, a bottle of soda has remarkably poor effects on satiety and people don’t compensate for the sugar in sodas by eating less of other foods.
How:You can substitute all or part of your regular sweet with fruit. And because fruits vary in their sweetness, you can choose a fruit that is as sweet as you need to feel a similar level of satisfaction to your old sugary treat. If you already eat fruit instead of dessert or other treats, you can experiment with a new fruit or smaller portion size.
When:Pick a time of day when you already eat sweets, like after dinner or during the afternoon. Don’t forget to also buy the fruit instead of the sweet when you go shopping!
