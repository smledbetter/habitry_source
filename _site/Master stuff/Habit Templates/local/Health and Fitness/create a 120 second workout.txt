In order to move more, we're going to practice create a 120 second workout.
Why:This is a variation of an earlier habit where you created a 60-second workout. The reason is the same: long workouts are hard to work into a day. Now you have an opportunity to carve out a bit more time, either on top of an exercise routine you’re already doing, or as a way to get back into a regular routine.
How:Your workout doesn’t have to be intense. It can be anything that fits you. Some people can find two minutes to walk around the block when they need to clear their heads. Or you might want to do a pushup plank for one minute next to your bed when you get up and then a minute of body-weight squats. Or, if you’re still dancing for a minute in the shower each day, add another minute of dancing at the end of the workday.
When:Figure out a time of day when you have an extra minute, extra privacy, or don’t need to look fresh wherever you are next. This could be before you brush your teeth, before you go to bed, or on the way home from work.
