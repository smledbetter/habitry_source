In order to eat better, we're going to practice eat slowly.
Why:Most people eat really quickly and end up eating more than they need. By trying to stretch meals out to 20 minutes, you give your body a chance to actually feel itself getting full, instead of diving head first into extra portions.
How:If 20 minutes for a meal sounds scary, you could start with 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, whatever feels doable for you.

You can make this habit easier to do by aiming to do it only for certain meals. For example you could practice eating slowly at dinner, if thatâ€™s a meal you normally eat really fast.

You can also set a timer while you eat so you know how to pace yourself.
When:A great trigger to remember to eat slowly is hunger. Or you can set an timer to remind yourself to slow down.
