In order to feel better, we're going to practice reward yourself with something free that’s not food, drink, or exercise.
Why:It’s useful for our mental sanity to get your mind off of “fitness” sometimes. It also teaches us not to overindulge in food or exercise.
How:You could personalize this habit by number of times you reward yourself per day or week. And the reward can be anything you want! It can be a (literal) pat on the back, a simple, “good job” or a deep, cleansing breath. You can also watch a favorite TV show, listen to a podcast, or go for a walk.
When:Pick a habit that you already do every day, so that it reminds you to reward yourself. This works especially well if you there is a habit that you are not particularly fond of doing: like your dishes or flossing.
