In order to move more, we're going to practice add a 60 second workout. Why:When people try to start an exercise habit, they often think they’re expected to work out 30-60 minutes per day, sometimes every day of the week. But when you’re just starting out, that can be a recipe of disaster — it’s way too big a project to move your whole life around to make room for an hour of exercise. An hour is huge! By starting super duper small, you can start thinking about easy ways to add exercise to your life and break out of the all-or-nothing mindset.
How:Your workout doesn’t have to be intense. It can be anything that fits you. Some people can find a minute to walk around the block when they need to clear their heads. Or you might want to do a pushup plank for one minute next to your bed when you get up. Or get creative and dance in the shower.
When:Figure out a time of day when you have an extra minute, extra privacy, or don’t need to look fresh wherever you are next. This could be before you brush your teeth, before you go to bed, or on the way to your job (maybe it takes a minute to climb the stairs instead of taking the elevator?).
