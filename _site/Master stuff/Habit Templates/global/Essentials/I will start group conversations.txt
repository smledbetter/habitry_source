In order to support belonging, we're going to practice start group conversations.Why:Habits are hard because clients try to build them alone. You can make it easier by helping clients build habits together.
How:

Ask them open-ended questions. What habit do they want to work on? How do they want to do the habit? Once the habit is picked, ask them about their experience doing the habit. Questions that get clients talking about how they are living up to their values (autonomy), getting better every day (competence), and a prized member of the group (belonging) work well here. 
When:
That will depend on how often and when you decide to talk to your group(s). Pick a trigger that will remind you to initiate the conversation(s).
