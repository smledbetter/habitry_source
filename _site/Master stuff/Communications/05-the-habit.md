##Email #4: The Habit

To make it easier to understand, this email walks through an example "food tracking" habit. But you can adapt this template for any habit you want your clients to practice.

SUBJECT: [ClientName], here’s our first habit!

Hey [ClientName],

Your to-do list for today:

1. Read this email to learn about the Food Tracking habit and how to make it work for you.

2. Go to [Insert Community Platform. E.g., Habitry platform, Facebook Group, etc] to discuss and ask questions about the habit.

3. Post your personal version of the Food Tracking habit in [Insert Community Platform. E.g., Habitry platform, Facebook Group, etc]!

**The Habit:** I Will Track What I Eat

**Why Do I Want To Do This Habit?**

[Provide one-two sentences on why doing this habit is important.]

Getting a really good picture of what you’re eating now, day to day, is going to be a great starting place for what we do. The most important step in change is to create awareness. 

So we start with tracking protein! As crazy as it sounds, at this point, we don’t even care that you change how much protein, or carbs, or fats you eat. 

**How Can I Make This Habit Easy?**

[Explain to the client why making the habit as easy as possible is important and how they can personalize it their individual level of confidence]

One of the most important things for you to succeed in [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] is custom tailoring each habit to you.

For this habit, and every other habit that you’ll do, we’ll do that by asking you to fill in the blanks in this sentence:

>I am 90-100% confident that I will **[insert habit]** for **[insert how much/how often]** after I **[habit to piggyback on]** for the next 7 days.

The first step is to scale the habit to something you are 90-100% confident you can do. 

You might want to track specific meals (just breakfasts, lunches, or dinners), or specific days (e.g., Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays). 

This is very important: Whatever you pick, it should be as easy as brushing your teeth. 

**When Am I Going To Do The Habit?**

[Help clients figure out a "piggyback habit" or trigger, which reminds them to do the habit.]

You should plan to track what you eat right after a habit you already. So if you are going to track what you eat during dinner, finishing your dinner might be a good trigger to remind you to track what you just ate. 

**Post Your Personal Version of The Habit!**

[Ask them to post a personal version of the habit]

Go to [Insert Community Platform. E.g., Habitry platform, Facebook Group, etc] and post your personal version of the habit. 

Here’s a template:

I am 90-100% confident that I will track what I eat by **[insert how]** after I **[insert piggyback habit]** for **[insert how many days this week]**.

Here’s an example:

I am 90-100% confident that I will track what I eat by writing down what I eat at dinner in my journal after I am done eating dinner, for 4 out of 7 days this week.

P.S. Don’t worry about making it perfect. We can always help you scale the habit to fit your life. In fact, that’s the whole point of coaching!
