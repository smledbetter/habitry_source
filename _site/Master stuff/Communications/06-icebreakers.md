##Post #1: Icebreakers

For your clients, the first day of a Habitry group is a bit like the first day of school. They will be excited, probably a touch nervous, and wondering: “Will the other kids like me?”

There will be a bit of tension in the air.

But don’t worry. We have a little trick up our sleeve for using that social tension to our advantage: icebreakers.

**What Are Icebreakers?**

For our purposes, icebreakers are open-ended questions that have three design features:

1. They remove the fear of speaking up and
2. They elicit similarities between clients so that
3. Clients feel like they belong in a community of people just like them

The best icebreakers help your clients feel that they will not be embarrassed for sharing information about themselves or making suggestions. They help us create a climate of speaking up.  That is crucial so that we can maximize what clients share and learn from each other.

The best icebreakers help clients learn that others in the group share the same values, personality, interests, and life experiences. The social psychology research is clear: we like being around other people who are similar to us, because it makes us feel good about ourselves. If you nail steps 1 and 2, then your clients will feel like they belong in community of people just like them from Day One. That’s important, because as Coach Stevo says, “People rarely change people; communities change people”.
