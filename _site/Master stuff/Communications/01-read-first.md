##Introduction

![Habitry by Week](http://answers.habitry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/habitry-by-week.png)

Habitry is about bringing together a group of clients ready to change their lifestyle, communicating with that group in the right way, and explicitly and transparently creating a culture of change. The evidence-based foundations and steps for creating this culture are explained elsewhere (see: [Creating a Culture of Change](https://github.com/habitry/habitry-system/blob/master/Habitry.md#creating-a-culture-of-change)). 

Habitry Coaches have helped 500+ online clients using the Habitry System.

Successful Habitry Group launches tend to have some specific communications sent to clients in the week leading up to the launch and then a regular series of communications during each two-week habit practice. If that seems a little daunting, don’t worry. We’ll show you exactly what to communicate to clients and provide examples so you can set your clients up for maximum success!

**NOTE:** Like everything else in the Habitry System, the templates below are just suggestions. You may want to do things differently, and that’s totally cool with us! In fact, we’d love for you to share it with us in the Motivate Collective: http://habitry.com/collective.

## Templates for pre-launch.

### Emails

The emails below will help your clients understand what to expect. These are typically sent in the week prior to the launch date of the Habitry Coaching Group.

#### Email #1: Welcome ###
A “Welcome” email, sent when they sign-up, to get them excited about officially being in the group.
