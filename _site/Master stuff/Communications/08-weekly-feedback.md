##Post #3: Weekly Individual Messages 

We send a weekly message to each client to review with them how did they did in the past week. This is used to keep them moving forward and provides an opportunity to ask for support.

Hi [ClientName],

Weekly check-in time! It seems like you did the protein habit 6 out of 7 days last week. Does that seem accurate? :)

Some of your highlights from the past week:

* You leveled-up your planning skills. It’s really great to see how you planned out protein for a few days so that you could keep playing the fat loss game despite being out of town. That’s literally Rockstar status! [Specific and positive feedback connecting their actions to the best version of themselves]
* Kept bringing positive energy to the group (that post describing your favorite way to prepare protein was useful!) [Specific and positive feedback connecting their actions to the group]

What can we do to help you get started with the habit this week? :) [Focusing client back on process]
