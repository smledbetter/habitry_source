##Post #4: Weekly Group Review 

One of the most valuable tools for improving your Habitry Coaching Group will be having dedicated time every Monday before the announcement of the new habit to reflecting on the previous habit. This allows the people that did really well and the people that struggled to inform each other and take those lessons into the next, new habit. We recommend giving the reflection some structure such as a series of open-ended questions. Here are ones that we've used:

- What went well; what did you learn?"
- How will you use what you learned to inform your next habit?
- What parts or how much of this habit will you continue to do?
- When this program is over, what will you continue doing?

And don't be afraid to let people really hash it out. Some of the most useful discussions we've facilitated started with a client saying, "I hated this!"
