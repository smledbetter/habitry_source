#How do I ask people to become community leaders?

##Quick Summary

Get clear on what help you want from them. Empower them and get them to invest in the community by asking them what they think you should do.

###How to Start

Before asking people to become community leaders, we suggest getting clear on what you’d like to get out of them.

* What would you like to get them to do in the group? 
* What‘s your definition of a successful community leader? 
* What kind of person are they? 
* What value would they provide to the community? 

Once you have an idea of answers to those questions, it‘s time to reach out. 

Start by empowering them to invest in the community. And to do that, we need to get them talking about what THEY think of the community and where they’d like to see it go. 

The easiest way to do that is to have personal conversations with those some of your candidates, and ask them a simple open-ended question: 

>Hey! What do you think of (name of your community)?”

They‘ll say something like “This group is awesome, but here‘s what I‘d like to see happen.” 

Whatever they suggest, even if it surprises you, run with it, praise it, and show them that you are EXCITED by their suggestions. 

Alternatively, they might give you specific problems they are working on (“I’m trying to be more consistent with my workouts”).

At that point, it’s useful to have a motivational interviewing-style conversation to elicit from them ways they could solve their problem. 

And then ask them if they would want to post in the group about their progress. 

Then wait. 

It usually takes about a week for them to start posting more and taking action.
