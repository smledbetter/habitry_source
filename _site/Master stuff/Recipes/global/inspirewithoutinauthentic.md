#How do I inspire clients without being inauthentic?

##Quick Summary
On a 10 point scale of enthusiasm, just be about one point higher than they are.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Meet them where they are at, be empathetic with their situation, and kindly but firmly help them achieve something NOW.

* Gauge your client’s level of enthusiasm/intrinsic motivation/energy level and place your energy output to them a couple of points higher.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “I used to try to “fake it” in group training. I eventually stopped cause I never feel like I “made it” and hated feeling fake. Some years later I actually found that to be both 1) normal, and 2) probably a good thing. Because… We cannot motivate others. We can only create the conditions in which they can motivate themselves. And I know I’m better at the latter being myself. ” – Sean Flanagan

* “Your job is to be a superconductor. You don’t create energy; you minimize resistance.” – Geoff Girvitz
