#My client keeps complaining about lack of results. What do I do?

##Quick Summary
Empathize with your client’s frustration and get them re-focused on the process.

###How to Start

Your client is probably defining their progress in terms of an outcome goal (fat loss, muscle gain, jobs/promotions obtained, etc).

That’s a problem, because outcome goals are realized much more slowly than clients want, and outcomes are largely outside of client control. That’s why it’s easy to get demotivated by them.

Start by showing your client that you empathize with their frustration.

Next, have a conversation with them with the intent of re-defining progress in terms of a mutually agreed upon process goal that can be attained easily and quickly.

Finally, whenever your client takes a step toward attaining that process goal, provide specific, positive, and credible feedback.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* The current consensus seems to be: avoid bringing up outcome goals when you can, talk about and give feedback on the process as much as possible, and empathize with clients when they feel demotivated. 

* Seth Munsey says, “The less I talked about appearance and weight with my clients, the more fun they would have in class and the longer they would stick around.” 

* Coach Stevo reminds us that “Results are feedback. Results are an answer to the question, ‘How am I doing?’ and ‘Is this worth it?’ Our job should be to help them move forward by giving process-related feedback often.” 

* Georgie Fear recommends communicating with your clients that you “HEAR them. Being frustrated is hard! Especially when you’re unhappy with where you are.”

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* “Get clients addicted to the process by asking regularly asking them ‘What did you do well’ and ‘What did you learn?’” – Coach Stevo

* “Give specific positive feedback on anything related to the process that your client is already doing well, so they feel like they are moving in the right direction.” – Omar Ganai

* “Get your client a quick win. Get her hooked. Let her see a change she is looking for. Then you can focus on slowing things down and building maintainable habits.” – Nick Sorrell

* “I don’t define results for them, or even ask them for their definition of results. Because, do they really know? I don’t think so… I just get them into class, introduce them to everyone, get them winning right away, and deliver a ton of high fives. No expectations set.” – Seth Munsey
