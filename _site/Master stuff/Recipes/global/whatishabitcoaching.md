#What is habit-based coaching?

##Quick Summary
Habit-based coaching is a philosophy of communication and programming with the goal of facilitating permanent, sustainable behavior change for clients.

###How to Start

There has been a lot written on habits, behavior change, and client communication styles, but the foundational principles are:

__1. Clients basically know what to do; they just can’t make themselves do it.__ Habit-based coaching is not a replacement for quality coaching advice, but rather an expansion of the “coaches’ toolkit” to include communication and programming techniques that facilitate client motivation.

__2. Meet people where they’re at.__ In order to facilitate change, we must go to the Client’s Point A and help them find a path away from it.

__3. In the long run, habit trumps will.__ We strive to help our clients create the conditions (environmental, social, and psychological) that maximize the probability of success. Habit-based coaches are primarily concerned with the answer to the question, “but will you actually do it?”

__4. Know your scope.__ A carpenter and a orthopedic surgeon do not have the same job, even though they use similar tools. Similarly, a coach is not a therapist or a psychologist.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

Coach Stevo, Omar Ganai, Georgie Fear, Roland Fisher, Sean Flanagan, Josh Hillis, Spencer Nadolsky, Jennifer Campbell, Annie Brees, Lauren Koski, and many others in the [Motivate Collective] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1399214610300935/) work in groups, both online and in person, to help people focus on changing one habit at a time, together. Many others use habit-centered approaches one-on-one for nutrition and lifestyle behavior. Coach Stevo and Spencer Nadolsky use habit-centered approaches for Strength Training. James Clear uses them for productivity.

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* “We only track one habit at a time.” – Coach Stevo

* “You didn’t fall off the wagon. THERE IS NO WAGON. No track, no road, you’re not “out of the groove” or “off the rails”, “up a creek” or any other metaphor we use to say we’re struggling. You’re where we ALL ARE: living a real life, that comes complete with easier time and harder times. That’s where you have always been and where you always will be.” – Georgie Fear

* “There is no ‘after.'” – Josh Hillis
