#How do you get people to become process oriented?


##Quick Summary
Keep asking them about the process. Show interest in the process. Reinforce how much they are enjoying the process.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Sell the process. Explain to them why focusing on the process will produce the outcomes they want.

* Praise the process, not the product.

* Set process goals instead of outcome goals. For example, “I will make 10 sales calls this week” instead of “I will close 10 sales this week.”

* Keep asking them how they’re doing NOW.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “Help them understand they have choices, every process is made up of several small choices, then make suggestions for how they can change those choices” – Jonathan Chant

* “Minimize using the nominalization of verbs and adjectives, and use the gerund or ‘-ing’ form or present tense. Nominalizing is basically making a noun out of a verb or adjective. For instance, a person who ‘runs’ might be called a ‘runner’, a person who ‘trains’ other people can be called a ‘trainer.’ The problem that it can have is that it freezes or makes static the activity of running, and training. Whereas going through a process, it shows that you are evolving, growing and changing.
Some other examples of nominalizations are phrases like ‘I want to be skinny’ or ‘I want to be strong’. Strong and skinny are adjectives that have become a static nominalization. What the person would want to say is ‘I am developing the skills and habits of a strong/skinny person.’
” – KC Ushijima

* “Help them recognize the immediate/short term benefits they get from doing whatever it is and why these benefits are important to them.” – Rebecca Schubert
