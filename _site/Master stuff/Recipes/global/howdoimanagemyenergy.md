#How do I manage my energy level so that I don’t feel so emotionally drained by the end of the day?

##Quick Summary
Understand that your energy levels will rise and fall throughout the day. Match your tasks to your energy levels. Also, make time for yourself to do things you enjoy and that you find restorative.
###How to Start

1. Make time in your day to relax, unplug, or do an activity you enjoy. Block this time in your calendar and make it sacred.

2. Monitor your emotional energy. You want to empathize with your clients and keep them positive but you don’t get caught up in their tumultuous roller coasters of emotion.

3. Practice what you preach. Make sure you’re sleeping well, eating well, exercising often, and managing your relationships and stress levels.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* Anchor your energy levels to the client’s. If they’re a 4 out of 10, just be a 5 or 6 yourself. They’ll appreciate you meeting them where they’re at and you can help them bump up a notch or two that session.

* Resolve conflicts with others and yourself.

* Take 5-15 minute breaks between clients to reset energy levels.

* Have a creative hour or time every day where you pursue a creative hobby that has nothing to with your work.

* Unplug your internet and turn your phone off for an hour or two in the evening.
