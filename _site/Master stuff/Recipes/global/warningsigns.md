#What are some warning signs that someone is about to fall off the wagon? What can you do about it?

##Quick Summary
The biggest warning sign is a gradual reduction in communication (frequency and amount). Make it easy for them to re-engage with you.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Create a safe climate for clients to come to when they fall off the wagon. Set the expectation ahead of time that no one is perfect.

* Make it easy for them to re-engage with you. For example, let them know that simply the act of checking in with you or your coaching group is a step forward and a sign of progress.

* Teach clients how to recognize their own warning signs and how to act when they notice them.

* Reframe. There is no “wagon” to “fall off" from.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “Every client will struggle from time to time. Every one. The question is, do they feel safe to come to the coach/community with their concern? Or do they feel like they are “off the wagon” that everyone else is on and it will take a lot to “get back on”. In my experience, it’s setting the expectation ahead of time that it’s ok to not be perfect. We are human. The best place to be if you’re struggling is here, with us. Some clients will still isolate themselves… because they have a lot of long term programming that tells them to do that, and trying to get them to reengage will feel controlling for them. All you can do is create the space, let them know it’s ok to struggle, and give them the opportunity to do what they will.” – Ashley Palmer

* “I honestly think this question is great, and also the wrong question. A coach does a disservice if they try and catch it and intervene. The better help is to teach the client how to recognize their own warning signals and to act.” – Roland Fisher

* “What wagon?” – Devra Mattes

* “I don’t worry about predicting or stopping them if we’re talking about overeating episodes or days of unbridled indulgence. Part of the journey is managing those, so I expect them to happen sooner or later and don’t sweat it at all. I wouldn’t want to stop them from getting that lesson. If we’re talking about warning signs someone may quit coaching, I’d say not returning emails or automated checkins.” – Georgie Fear
