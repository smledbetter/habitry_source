#How can I help a client realize their self-worth?


##Quick Summary
Your clients may not feel they are “worth” the effort to change and struggle to think positively about themselves. By keeping a positive focus on what they’re doing well, what they’re learning, and who they’re becoming, we can help them discover their own self-worth.



###How to Start

1. Refocus the client on the things they are doing well right now and the things they’re learning through the process.

2. Ask your client to recall a past experience where they felt successful. Try to help them uncover the qualities that made them feel that way.

3. Many people with low self-worth are helpers. Start by helping them to understand that if they always put themselves last, they won’t be capable of helping the ones they love.

4. Call attention to your clients language and self-talk. Are they constantly putting themselves down or are they allowing they celebrating their wins along the way?

5. Know your scope. A carpenter and a orthopedic surgeon do not have the same job, even though they use similar tools. Similarly, a coach is not a therapist or a psychologist.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Yusuf Clack had success asking clients to recall a time when they felt successful.

* Dan Rollins and Susan Ogilvie recommend asking clients what their best version of themselves or their future self would say to them right now. Would they be encouraging or negative about change?

* Dan Rollins also suggests a values assessment. What do you value about yourself and what do others value about you. You may find more hidden qualities than you thought.

* Josh Hillis recommends a daily gratitude journal to help people change their negative self-talk and appreciate themselves.

* Omar Ganai reframes his clients’ negative self-impressions as strengths. For example, client says: “My biggest challenge is going to be finding things I am grateful about myself.” So he flips it around: “Perhaps you can start with this: you have ample self-awareness, which helps you identify your challenges”

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* “A lot of times people that have low self worth are very busy trying to help others… Getting them to realize that they can’t keep putting themselves last is sometimes the first step. Get them to see that they would be a better x (parent, spouse etc) if they did some self care is a good carrot to guide them towards the self awareness they need to realize that relationships aren’t a zero sum equation ( aka one must suffer for the other to thrive) and that both parties need to benefit for things to be sustainable. Then you can move to exercises in self worth.” – Thom Lamb

* “I like to make it action/discipline oriented. When people are *doing* something new, you can build on that they have a new trajectory to their life, and that they actually have evidence of it.” – Josh Hillis
