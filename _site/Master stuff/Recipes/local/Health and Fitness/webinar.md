#How do I create a webinar?

##Quick Summary
Pick a theme. Pick a technology. Schedule, announce, and record!

###How to Start

1. Scope and topic: Identify your audience for the webinar. Choose a topic relevant to their needs and interests that you can help them with. Then decide the overall message you wish to communicate and subtopics you want participants to think about. 

2. Scheduling: For a small group (10 or fewer), ask everyone to agree on a time using Doodle. For a large group, poll a few people on likely times and then choose one. You can always repeat the webinar if it’s popular and people miss it. 

3. Tech setup: Use a tool like Eventbrite, GoToWebinar, Google Forms, or your own page builder to create a signup form. You can charge a small amount to encourage attendance or leave it open to all. To convince people that they want to sign up, write your topic summary using language that describes your audience’s problems and the benefits you’ll be offering them in your presentation. Test the webinar technology, including recording, with a friend before the webinar date.

4. Promotion and prep: Announce the date and time of your webinar on all your social and owned channels. Prepare your presentation visuals, if any. Remind everyone, including signups, that your webinar is coming up. 

5. On webinar day: Host your webinar and shine! Follow up publicly with a newsletter and blog post sharing the recording.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Francis Nitsch provides a weekly webinar members with a lesson and the opportunity for questions at the end. They use GoToWebinar and find it powerful and effective. So far participation has been about 25-30%, and about half of their members are on board.

* Sarah Campbell hosts presentations plus Q&A time on topics that came up during a habit project, like perfectionism or self-talk. Attendance varies, but the people that attend get a lot out of it. Format was a slide presentation with discussion breakouts, homework for attendees, and weekly meetings for people working on the habit or skill.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “I’d suggest taking the questions via written form before the call and then answering them during the call. Otherwise you may have 25 people trying to talk at the same time.” – Jessica Owens Mauk

*  “Amber and I use “Hangouts on Air” to record us answering pre-submitted questions.” – Sean Flanagan

* “I use Hangouts for 5 or fewer people and Goto Meeting for more.” – Dominic Matteo

* “I ask clients to pick times via Doodle, and I pick the one that pisses off the least people.” – Coach Stevo

* “I highly recommend using the company zoom.us This is what I use for my online coaching and chatting with friends and family from Australia. You can control large groups quite well and members can log in using their phones.” – Wesley Wood

* “It’s tricky to get times that work for people. We ended up doing two time slots, one early and one late, and then those in Europe could participate without too much trouble.” Sarah Campbell
