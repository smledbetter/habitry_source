#How can I go from charging per session to charging per month?

##Quick Summary
Understand the reasons why moving to a membership model is important for you and your clients, then create a structure and a transition plan that honors your clients’ needs and your value as a coach.

###How to Start

1. Brainstorm and write out all the reasons why you want to move to a membership service versus pay-per session. How will it benefit your clients? How will it benefit you? Practice explaining it verbally and in writing so you are clear and confident when you have a conversation with clients. Think about what their possible objections might be and how you can address them.
* Pros: Consistent stream of income for trainer, creating stability in their business and career. Clients are incentivized to train more frequently and more consistently. Clients become responsible for scheduling themselves into your calendar and planning ahead for vacation and travel.
* Cons: Clients may feel overcommitted and upset if they subscribe to a membership they don’t end up using to its full extent. Pricing may seem more expensive if they see it as a monthly charge versus one-time purchase every several weeks/months (with a training package). For these cons, find ways you can offer options that overcomes these objections.

2. Create a rough draft of pricing (see sample grid below), and consider the following options for discounts:

* Higher frequency of training per week or per month
* Longer lengths of contracts (3 month, 6 months, 1 year)
* If you’d still like to include a pay-per-session option, find the highest per session price of all your memberships and set the single session rate higher.

3. Outline your policies for:

4. Draft recommendation letters/emails for each of your clients, outlining their options based on their average training frequency and the rate they’re most comfortable with right now. Rehearse what you might say and how you’ll approach each client and their personalities.

5. Talk to your 1-3 closest clients about the transition – ask them how they feel about it. What are their concerns? How can you make them feel comfortable? What are their questions? Are they interested and understanding or are you finding yourself defending the change?

6. Based upon those conversations, make adjustments to your pricing, structure, and/or policies.

7. Set a realistic transition date – at least 4-8 weeks out and be clear on what will change and when.

8. Speak directly with your clients, either in-person or over the phone, then send a follow-up email with your recommendations. Consider being open to creating a personalized membership option for them, outside of the grid you created. Take time to ensure it’s within your rate range and something they can commit to.

9. Advertise the most popular 1-4 membership options to the public (on your website, marketing flyers, etc.). Continue to use your fully filled out pricing grid for personalizing memberships, but the entire grid is likely too much information to include in marketing.

10. Consider using an auto-payment/billing system like PayPal, Square, Pay Simple to start monthly auto-payments. You can also set up bank-to-bank transfers (ACH) for a very low transaction rate.

11. Consider using a scheduling software service like Zen Planner or Mind Body and ask your clients to book themselves into your calendar. A public Google calendar is a good free alternative.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Josh Hillis uses monthly memberships for his online groups, in-person small group(4:1) training sessions and in-person private training sessions. Memberships are based on number of times per week the client trains and the membership contract length (3 months- 1 year). When a client is away 2 or more weeks, he prorates the month, or puts the membership on hold (he does the same for his own extended vacations). To make up sessions, he has clients front load and back load before and after absences.

* Robin Mungall offers a discount on an all upfront charge for membership, based upon a 48-week year (assuming 4 weeks vacation for trainer and client). He promotes the idea that the membership includes support between in-person sessions and while clients are on vacation and when there’s extra time in the month, he’ll invite them in for extra sessions, not letting the weekly or monthly “limit” determine how often they come in.

* Andy Hsieh recommends considering the 24-Hour Fitness model that allows clients to “roll-over” unused sessions to the next month so they have the opportunity to use them.

* Seth Munsey offers 3-month and 12-months contracts for either 8 or 12 classes per month, plus an extra class for 5-week long months. He includes 2 free Saturday classes to help clients makeup sessions and mix up the people attending to improve the community atmosphere.

* Anneke Cannon charges monthly based on number of sessions (minimum of 4) and adjusts up for longer months. She finds that the membership creates more consistency with her clients. To help plan ahead, she asks clients to notify 2 weeks in advance if the client is not training the following month (she uses a month-to-month contract).

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* Find an approach that works for you and your clients – just like with all things coaching-related, there is no one-size-fits-all solution

*  Consider what outcomes you’d like to incentivize and base your discounts on the options that support those outcomes.

*  Plan your transition from packages/pay-per session and set policies for vacations, illness, and late cancels.

*  Consider using software tools to reduce your administrative time and create more autonomy for your clients.
