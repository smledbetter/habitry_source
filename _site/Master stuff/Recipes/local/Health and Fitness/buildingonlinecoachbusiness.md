#How do I build an online coaching business?

##Quick Summary
Starting your own online business is rewarding but it takes a long time. Longer than you think. Maintain a part time revenue stream while you build up your business. Make sure you’re very clear on WHO you serve and build strong relationships with those people.

###How to Start

1. Decide who you are going to serve and how. You are going to serve them. Get very specific. The more you can narrow this down, the more receptive people will be to your material.

2. Decide what social media you will use to promote yourself (facebook, instagram, twitter, blog, website, etc…). Limit yourself to no more than three sources.

3. Create content that speaks directly to the people you aim to serve. Videos are especially helpful since they create a more human connection and build more trust.

4. One of your biggest challenges will be your own mindset. Be patient, consistent, and persistent. This will take longer than you think but it will be worth it. Be sure to ask the Motivate Forum for support when you need it.

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

* Roland Fisher and Georgie Fear have become very successful by being very clear on who they serve and how.

* Sean Flanagan found that making weekly videos helped him to create a deeper connection with people.

* Josh Hillis suggests keeping your in-person coaching until you are so busy online you don’t have time to personal train.

###Top Tips From The Motivate Collective

* “You must have an immediate answer to the question ‘Who do you serve and how?’ Don’t skimp on this. To drive the point a bit, we have a smaller list than many people here, but we have a 65% open rates on emails and we have enough business to hire other coaches. All because we made damn sure that we reach people and build a relationship.” – Roland Fisher

*  “Diversity of revenue streams is crucial. Especially if your marketing systems online go cold due to Google terminating your Adwords account or Facebook terminating your FB ad account.” – Sean Flanagan

* “Things take a long time. The smart play is to keep personal training until you are so busy with your online business that you *have* to cut back at personal training. And then cut back… Just like with fat loss, there is no “hero step” you can take. The answer is consistent progress, and stacking progress over time.” – Josh Hillis
