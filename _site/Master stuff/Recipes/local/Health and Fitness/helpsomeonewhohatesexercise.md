#How do I help someone who hates exercise to start moving?


##Quick Summary
Help people think more broadly about movement. Get them thinking outside the gym by asking them about kinds of movement they like.

###How to Start

Usually the problems here are mismatched expectations between what the client is thinking you want them to do and what they need to do. And if someone is just starting out, they really just need to do something. So with an open mind, ask the client about other forms of movement to see if you can find something they like or least don’t hate.

* Do they like walking?

* When was the last time they played catch?

* How do they get to work?

###What Other Coaches Are Doing

The general consensus in the Motivate Collective is, “meet them where they’re at.” Many in the Collective have seen this to be as simple as helping them to creatively brainstorm alternatives. 

* Instead of telling them why exercise is awesome, Seth Munsey recommends putting yourself in the client’s shoes and remembering that exercise might not be an obviously good thing and might be just a weird hobby that other people seem to enjoy: “Picture yourself trying to convince someone how awesome model trains are.” 

* Coach Stevo also suggests skipping the conversation and going straight to the demonstration. Instead of “exercising,” meet your client in a park and play with a frisbee. Or better yet, invite a bunch of people to join you.

###Top Tips from the Motivate Collective

* Always meet them where they’re at.

* “Give specific positive feedback on anything related to the process that your client is already doing well, so they feel like they are moving in the right direction.” – Omar Ganai

* Don’t assume they know what you mean by “movement.” You might mean walking; they might be thinking Ironman.
