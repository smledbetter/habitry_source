# The Habitry Source Code
This is the official home of Habitry, a habit-based system for creating communities of change created by Habitry, Co. 

If you're looking for a book-like thing, you should read the [tutorial](https://github.com/habitry/habitry_source/blob/master/Habitry_Tutorial.md).

If you want to get started fast, fork it.

Templates are provided as Markdown files, which can be previewed and edited within github, or by using a markdown editor like [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) or [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com)

##Welcome
If you are looking for the most effective behavior change system in the world (and the only open-source one), you're found it.

##What is Habitry Source?
Habitry Source is the master set of documents for implemnting the Habitry Method. In Wordpress parlance, Habitry Source is the "Codex": Everything you need to get started using habits to affect your community or team habits is in here. All you have to do is fork and start.

##How to Use

###Getting Started
Read the [ReadMe](https://github.com/habitry/habitry_source/blob/master/readme.md), read the [tutorial](https://github.com/habitry/habitry_source/blob/master/Habitry_Tutorial.md) if you want a more "book-like" experience, and read the [getting started guide](https://github.com/habitry/habitry_source/blob/master/Getting-Started-Guides/Health-and-Fitness/Health%20and%20Fitness.md) if you want a checklist format.

###Organization
Habitry Source is organized into 3 main folder trees like this:

- Skills
	- Global
		- Micro Skills
	- Local
		- Micro Skills
- Habits
	- Global
		- Habit Templates
			- Conversation Starters
	- Local
		- Habit Templates
			- Conversation Starters
- Recipes
	- Global
	- Local
	

####Skills
Skills are desired behaviors. The stuff you wanna learn how to do with "unconsious mastery." The big complex, performance goals that most of dream of doing without thinking. The stuff that gets Michael Jordan down the court or Dan John to throw something far. The stuff that probably interested you about behavior change in the first place.

#####Micro Skills
Micro-skills are the smaller components of Skills. The stuff we can practice, aka "process goals." These are dribbling, and doing turns in the discus. These are the little things that add up to the Skills you dream of doing.

####Habits
Habits are the heart of the Habitry Method. Habits are how you get a whole community to practice micro-skills together in order to learn the greater skills. We also call these, "shared process goals." We keep these in a separate folder because the even though the Habits can be thought of as a "smaller component" of a micro-skill, it's better to think of the "Skills" folder as what generates the Habits folder (even though Recipes can influence the generation of both, but more on that later). The Habits are what you and you're team are going to be working with every day.

#####Habit Templates
Habit Templates are what get "delivered" to the people you're helping. They're how you introduce the group practice for a pre-set amount of time (usually 7-14 days) in a way that makes them the most likely to want to do it. These are carefully worded in order to balance the flexibilty needed to allow anyone to "personalize" the habit into a Habit Statement, but share enough commonality to help everyone move in the same direction. We have included a standard template and we also made a [form](https://habitry.typeform.com/to/tWaGnO) you can fill out to generate your own templates.

######Conversation Starters
Conversation starters are the "posts" you send to the group when you want to get them thinking about the Habit and what they're learning. Some of these posts are "special" such as "Goldilocking" and "Momentum Plans." We use a rough outline to generate these scheduled posts, shown in the "getting started guide."

We have included templates for each of these formats in "Communications" and made a ~~form for creating your own.~~

####Recipes
Recipes are the FAQ section of Habitry Source. These are the "algorithms" or "config files" that help you interact andcontinually  promote a sense of momentum, autonomy, and belonging in your teams. If you have a specific question about "What do I do when..." or "how do I know if..." the recipes are the place to look. You can generate your own recipes using our included templates or our ~~form generator which will help your team create their own recipes.~~

####Global Files
Global files are skills, habits, and recipes that every Habitry Program needs to function well. Think of these as the skills, habits, and repices of running a Habitry Program (yes, that's right: even Habitry can be taught using Habitry). If you want to get started on a Habitry Prgram and don't know what Habits to start with, a good way to go might be just starting with the Global Habits and filling the rest out later.

If you don't know how to help people learn these, we recommend taking _Essentials of Habit Coaching_ from Habitry, Co.

####Local Files
Local files are the skills, habits, and recipes that are specific to _your_ Habitry Program. These are the things that your team wants to learn in order to be better versions of themselves. You can use our stardard templates or the links to our forms to generate these files yourself.

~~###Habitry Site
When you fork this repository on github, it will automatically generate a new website available at `http://[username].github.io/[project name]`, where `[username]` is your github username and `[project name]` is the name of the repository you created for your Habitry Fork. You just have to go into settings and turn on the project site.~~

###Deciding What Habit to Do First
The easiest way to decide what habit your team should start with is to make a poll. Pick 3 Habit Templates and ask your team to pick the one that sounds "the most fun" to try first.
