##Welcome

We’re stoked you’ve decided to become a Habitry Pro! If you're anything like us, you became a coach to help people make real and permanent changes in their life. But let's be honest: coaching is hard. That’s why we created the Habitry Coaching Platform. To make coaching easier for coaches, and better for clients. If there’s one way to sum up the philosophy behind the world’s best coaching platform, it's this:

####**Habits** are hard. **We** make them easy.

Habits are hard because people try to build them alone. Habitry is a solution for building new habits by building them together. The Habitry Coaching Platform is designed using best practices from psychological science. And everything we've learned in the trenches by coaching thousands of clients, with dozens of coaches, over the past 5+ years. All in a beautiful, easy-to-use package. The result? You can help more clients become the best version of themselves, with less work. And clients feel like all the momentum in the world is on their side. 

In this short guide, we’ll show you the exact steps you can follow coach your Habitry Group through their first habit, and beyond. 

We can’t wait to see you create lasting change for your clients. 

Omar Ganaipo
Head of Coaching Success, Habitry

P.S. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me: omar@habitry.com. I’m always happy to talk!

##The Habitry Method: Big Picture View

There are three simple steps to the Habitry Method:

1. Pick a habit to work on, together.
2. Do it, together.
3. Talk about it, together.

That’s the big picture. We’ll walk you through the details in a bit. But first, let’s get your group ready so you can invite clients. 

##Preparing to Coach Your First Habit

Before we invite clients into your group, you’ll want to take care of two things:

1. Get clients excited about Habitry and preview what they can expect (We’ll show how).
2. Load the habit (at minimum, 48 hours before your group start date).

Okay, let’s go through each of those steps now.

###1. Get clients excited about Habitry

Getting clients excited about Habitry is easy. We’ll use two messages. I explain what they are below. After the explanation, you’ll find a template for each message that you can use. You can deliver these messages in-person, email, text, or whatever medium you feel is appropriate. The templates are formatted for emails. 

**The first message is to be sent right after they sign-up.** The purpose of the message is to induct them into the group, to build their anticipation by giving them a preview of what the group will be like, and to tell them how a Habitry Group is better and different from other types of coaching groups. Usually, you’ll give this message the workweek before your group start date, assuming your group starts on a Monday. 

Here is an template you can use:

>SUBJECT: [Insert Name of your Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] Begins Monday!

>Hey [Name], congratulations! You’re now officially a [Insert Group Name. E.g., "Fat Loss Rockstar"]! Over the coming months (or however long you need), we’re going to use the power of community support and habits to help you build a sustainable fat loss lifestyle. 

>On Sunday, I’ll send out an email inviting you to the Habitry app where all the magic will happen.

>But before we get started, I wanted to go over what you can expect from [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] and you should NOT expect:

>The [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] is NOT a “rapid fat loss” or meal-based program. We’ll be working on one habit at a time, which you’ll master with all the other [Insert Group Name. E.g., “Fat Loss Rockstars”]. 

>The community is where all the magic happens. It’s where you’ll get the most experience learning about how to actually make these habits work for your life. And where you’ll be meeting the other [Insert Group Name. E.g., Fat Loss Rockstars] on the same journey as you.

>As promised, the [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”] will be unlike any fat loss program out there. As [Insert Group Name. E.g., “Fat Loss Rockstars”], you can expect unlimited and unconditional support from me. So never hesitate to reach out!

>– Coach Name

**The second message is to be sent the day before the group starts.** The purpose of this email is to get them to introduce themselves to their group and how to use the Habitry Group for success.

Here’s a template you can use:

>SUBJECT: Welcome to [Insert Name of Habitry Coaching Group. E.g., “Rockstar Fat Loss Coaching Group”]!
Your to-do list for today:
1. Read this email
2. Go to the Habitry app and introduce yourself in the welcome post
Today is going to be mainly about logistics. We are going to start on the first habit tomorrow, but today is about laying the groundwork on two of the most important things we’ll be focusing on as we move forward: Community and Consistency.
What you can expect from us: daily accountability from an expert coach and weekly personal check-ins to get your feedback on how things are going.

>What we expect from you:

>A. Endeavor to practice the current habit daily (more on this tomorrow).
>B. Check-in daily via the threads that will be started to let us know if you did the habit (this is how we can keep track of >your progress).
>C. Respond to the daily reflection questions we leave on the check-in threads.
>D. Reach out daily to other community members.

>That being said, a big reason why Habitry Groups work is because everything is optional. So, aim to do these things everyday, but don’t make them a homework assignment. 

>Checking in and responding to the reflection questions are important for your own journey.  They help to reinforce the consistency needed to make each habit an actual habit.

>Additionally, reaching out to your teammates is important because it helps to foster the spirit of support and encouragement that is crucial for success. Some days we rock it, and some days we struggle a bit. Knowing that you have a core group of teammates (in addition to your coaches!) that are there for you regardless of how the day went can make the low days seem better, and the good days seem even more badass! 

>Ready to join your team? You’re just three steps away:

>1. Go to http://habitry.com/download to download and install the Habitry app.
>2. When the Habitry app asks you to input your code, use this: [CLIENT’S CODE]
>3. Introduce yourself in the welcome post in the app and join the discussion!

>If you’re using iOS 9, you may get an “Untrusted Enterprise Developer” alert when opening Habitry. It’s totally normal: Apple does this for apps that aren’t in the App Store yet (Habitry is in the process of applying). If you see this pop-up, go to Settings >> General >> Device Management (or, if you're using 9.1 or earlier, go to Settings >> General >> Profile) to >add Habitry as a trusted developer. 

>Finally, if you have any questions, feel free to post them in the group. Trust us, if you have a question, someone else has the same question. So ask away!

>– Coach Name

###2. Load the habit

Let’s take 15 minutes to walk you through setting up an example Food Tracking habit on the Habitry Coaching Platform.

If you want to use a different habit, you can write your own using the steps provided below. Or you can use one of the 24 habits in the Habitry Starter Kit. Just email me and I’ll send it to you.

Make sure you have a habit set up in the app at least 48 hours before your group starts.

1. Go to the Habitry Coaching Platform, tap on “Habits” at the bottom, then tap on the pen icon in the upper right corner.

2. The Habitry Coaching Platform will ask you, “What is the habit?” Provide a label for the habit. 

For example: “I will track what I eat.”

3. You’ll now be back on the Habits screen. Tap on “I will track what I eat.”

4. Select a start date. We recommend the upcoming Monday.

5. Fill out the “Why” section. 

Provide one or two reasons to clients about why they should practice the habit. Think tweet-length. 

For example: “Getting a really good picture of what you’re eating now, day to day, is going to be a great starting place for what we do. The most important step in change is to create awareness.”

6. Fill out the “How can I scale this habit?” section.

Provide an example or two to your clients on how they can make practicing the habit as easy as possible for them.

For example: “One of the most important things for you to succeed in [insert name of your Habitry coaching group] is tailoring each habit to you. 

For this habit, and every other habit that you’ll do, we’ll tailor it by asking you to fill in the blanks in this sentence: 

I am 90-100% confident that I will [insert habit] for [insert how much/how often] after I [habit to piggyback on] for the next 7 days. 

The first step is to scale the habit to something you are 90-100% confident you can do. 

You might want to track specific meals (just breakfasts, lunches, or dinners), or specific days (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays). 

This is very important: whatever you pick, it should be as easy as brushing your teeth.

7. Fill out the “What can I piggyback off of?” section.

Provide directions on how clients can create a trigger for the habit. 

For example: “You should plan to track what you eat right after a habit you already. So if you are going to track what you eat during dinner, finishing your dinner might be a good trigger to remind you to track what you just ate.”

You just finished loading a “I will track what I eat” habit into the Habitry Coaching Platform for your clients!

Now you just need to do one more task and you’ll be ready to invite clients into your Habitry Group.

###Suggested Posting Schedule for Your First Habit

We suggest you coach your group with a habit lasting two weeks. Below is a suggested posting schedule for your first habit. 

Coach tasks are highlighted in gold. Client tasks are highlighted in blue.

![alt text][firsthabitschedule]

[firsthabitschedule]: https://github.com/habitry/habitry_source/blob/master/Getting-Started-Guides/Health-and-Fitness/images/firsthabitschedule.jpg "Suggested Schedule for First Habit"

**If this feels like a lot, don’t worry, it’s actually not.** After coaching thousands of people and helping dozens of coaches, we’ve seen everything, so we have templates for everything. We’ll get into those later in the guide. For now, I just wanted to give you an idea of what the suggested posting schedule looks like for a two week habit. 

**Morning posts will typically come from you.** These aren’t blog posts. Think two-three sentences and an open-ended question to start a group discussion. Then your clients (your selected team leaders) will post check-in threads in the evening time. 

**I recommend checking on your group only twice a day.** Once in the morning and once in the evening, for 20-45 minutes. Anymore won’t be noticed by your clients. And it will also help your sanity :)

###Daily Walkthrough to Coach Your First Habit

Now that you have a general idea of the tasks you’ll be doing to coach your clients through their first habit, let’s get into the daily details. 

##Week 1, Sunday AM: Post an icebreaker

Icebreakers are open-ended questions that accomplish three things:

1. They remove the fear of speaking up and
2. They elicit similarities between clients so that
3. Clients feel like they belong in a community of people just like them

The best icebreakers help your clients feel that they will not be embarrassed for sharing information about themselves or making suggestions. They help us create a climate of speaking up. That is crucial so that we can maximize what clients share and learn from each other.

You can and should come up with icebreakers specific to the values, personality, interests, and life experiences of your community. However, below are 18 icebreakers that we’ve tested successfully on clients. We’ve listed them for inspiration. 

Pick one “serious” icebreaker and one “fun” icebreaker and post them into your group.

For example:

>Hey [Insert Group Name. E.g., "Fat Loss Rockstars"]! Introduce yourself and say hi.

>What’s the strongest thing you’ve ever done?
>Where would you hide a giraffe?

###18 Habitry-Tested Icebreakers

1. What’s the strongest thing you’ve ever done?
2. What’s your most silly fitness story?
3. What excites you the most about joining this community?
4. When was the last time you vomited, and why?
5. If you had a giraffe, where would you hide it?
6. If you could come back in your next life as an animal, what would it be?
7. Tell us about your favorite book when you were young.
8. What is your favorite movie, and why?
9. When was the last time you laughed so hard you cried?
10. If you had a theme song, what would it be, and why?
11. What is the title of your autobiography?
12. If you could have any superpower, what would it be, and why?
13. What is your signature dance move?
14. Who is your favorite person in the world, and why?
15. What era of history would you most like to vacation to?
16. If teleportation was possible, where would you go right now?
17. What exercise do you most enjoy, and why?
18. What’s one habit in the past that you’ve successfully built? How did you do it?

##Week 1, Sunday AM: Introduce the habit

Post a discussion thread to start a conversation about the habit. The goal of this thread is to get clients to post their personal habit statement. In English, that means you’ll want your clients to post when and how they’ll do the habit in the coming week.

Here’s an example:

>Hey [Insert Group Name. E.g., "Fat Loss Rockstars"]! 

>Here’s your to-do list for today:
1. Take 5 minutes to read this post to find out about our first habit (I will track what I eat) and how you can personalize it for *your* needs.
2. Share how and when you’ll do the habit (your personal habit statement) in the comments. We’ve provided a template at the end of the post!

>Habit: I will track what I eat

>What’s important about doing this habit?

>Getting a really good picture of what you’re eating now, day to day, is going to be a great starting place for what we do. The most important step in change is to create awareness.

>How can I personalize this habit to my needs?

>The first step is to scale the habit to something you are 90-100% confident you can do. 

>You might want to track specific meals (just breakfasts, lunches, or dinners), or specific days (Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays). 

>This is very important: whatever you pick, it should be as easy as brushing your teeth.

>Post your personal habit statement in the comments.

Here’s a template:

>I am 90-100% confident that I will [insert habit] for [insert how much or how often] after I [insert what’s going to remind you to do the habit] for the next 7 days.

>Here’s an example:

>I am 90-100% confident that I will track what I eat by writing down what I eat at dinner in my journal after I am done eating dinner, for 4 out of 7 days this week.

>P.S. Don’t worry about making this perfect. We’ll help you adjust. In fact, that’s the whole point of getting coached.

##Week 1, Sunday PM & Monday AM: Help personalize the habit

Once you’ve introduced the habit to clients, you’ll want to do three things:

1. Give each person a verbal high five for sharing their personal habit statement. This is as easy as saying “Awesome habit statement, (Name)!” or “Love your habit statement, (Name)!”

2. Double-check to see if everyone has shared their personal habit statement.

3. Answer any questions that clients might have.

##Week 1, Monday PM: Post the first check-in

Time to introduce your clients to one of the most important parts of the Habitry Method: the Two Questions. 

The real goal of a Habitry Coach should be to get clients to learn their own way forward. This is why so much emphasis is placed on the Two Questions. Coach Stevo pored over the Positive Psychology literature to find these two reflection questions. 

The “magical” thing about these two questions? They are inherently fun and self-rewarding to answer. And they help clients cultivate self-awareness. In fact, since reflection is the only thing that is actually repeated often enough to really become habit, it's the habit that we're actually trying to cultivate.

Below, we’ve provided a template post for you to introduce the Two Questions.

>Hey (Insert Group Name. E.g, “Rockstars”)!

>How was Day 1? Did you write a personalized version of the habit? If you haven't shared with the group yet, feel free to post in tonight's reflection.

>One of the funnest things you'll be doing during your time in [Insert Name of Your Habitry Group] is to answer... 

>The Two Questions!

>1. What did I do well today? 
>2. What did I learn today?

>These questions are so important that we want you to reflect on them every day.  

>They might seem too simple at first. But we’ve tested them on hundreds of clients and the results for fat loss are off the charts.

>The truth is, the most overlooked factor in building new habits is bridging the gap between what you want to do and the behavior that you're trying to make automatic. You've got to close the loop between your intention and your behavior, and it's as simple as answering The Two Questions.

>It might sound magical, but the 90 seconds it takes to answer the two questions in the group, will actually make doing your habits in real life a zillion times easier.

>So here they are for you. Let us know in the comments:

>1. What did I do well today? 
>2. What did I learn today?

##Week 1, Tuesday AM: Introduce team leaders

Today, your task is to pick your team leaders and introduce the concept of teams to your clients. 

###Teams

One of the early discoveries Coach Stevo made running Habitry groups was that as groups got larger, some conversations were just better and more useful with a smaller number of participants. Teams in Habitry Groups are not competitive, but collaborative.

Teams accomplish two things:

1. They help clients take more ownership over the group. This is great for motivation and engagement. It also makes your life a little bit easier :)

2. In larger groups, teams provide a smaller group of people with whom client can choose to discuss the habits and reflection questions.

####How to ask people to be Team Leaders

We anoint team leaders for every team. These people have one job: post the Two Questions every day.

We have found that the best people for this job are your most engaged members, not necessarily the members with the highest concordance.

Here’s one way you could ask:

>Hey (ClientName)! 

>One of the things we do is have someone be a team leader for each habit!

>Since we love the energy you’ve been bringing to our budding community,would you like to be team leader for this habit? 

>All you have to do is copy paste the Two Questions every day (plus a third fun/silly “bonus” question if you feel like).

>Let us know! :D

If they agree, thank them profusely. Then let your group know about the concept of teams. 

**If your group is more than 16 clients**, you might find it useful to divide the group into teams. You’ll probably want teams of 8 to ensure that 2-4 people are engaged at all times. 

Below is an example message you can use to announce teams and team leaders. 

Also, don’t worry too much about picking team names. Have some fun here. If you get stuck, animal names always work well!

>Hey (Group Name, i.e. “Fat Loss Rockstars”)! 

>People are most successful when they are empowered to make lifestyle changes with other people on the same journey as them. That’s why we’ve divided you into (insert number) team(s). We’ll shake these teams and team leaders up every habit so everyone will get the chance to work with everyone else!

>You’ll have the chance to check-in every night with your team, but post whatever you want to the whole group whenever you want to. Links, tips, thoughts, successes, struggles, anything you feel comfortable sharing. The purpose of the team is to make checking in easier for you, so you don’t need to worry about competing or anything. And we’ll still be coaching you privately and starting group discussions to help you, regularly. 

>So without further ado… here are the teams for this habit!

>Team Tiger
>Team Leader: (name of team leader)
>(Names of everyone else on the team)

>Team Lion
>Team Leader: (name of team leader)
>(Names of everyone else on the team)

**If your group is less than 16 clients**, your entire group will be one big team :) You can use the provided example below to announce teams.

>Hey (Group Name, i.e. “Fat Loss Rockstars”)! 

>People are most successful when they are empowered to make lifestyle changes with other people on the same journey as them. That’s why we’ll be giving one of you the chance to be team leader. We’ll shake the team leaders up every habit so everyone will get a chance.

>The team leader’s job is to post the check-in thread every night. But even if you aren’t team leader, feel free post whatever you want to the whole group whenever you want to. Links, tips, thoughts, successes, struggles, anything you feel comfortable sharing. The purpose of having a team leader is to give you more freedom to shape the direction of the group. And we’ll still be coaching you privately and starting group discussions to help you, regularly.

>So without further ado, (Name of team leader) has agreed to be team leader for this habit!

##Week 1, Tuesday PM: Provide team leader check-in template

Once you have a team leader, private message them the following template so they know exactly how to post the check-in thread every day.

Hey (Name of leader), here’s a template you can copy paste to post the check-in thread every day. Thanks again and don’t hesitate to message us if you have any questions!

>[Monday Check-In: Habit Name Goes Here]

>Hey team!

>If you did the habit, tap the checkmark at the bottom of the screen.

>1. What did you learn?

>2. What did you do well?

>Bonus: (insert fun bonus question here if you want).

##Week 1, Wednesday AM: Start a group discussion

>The real secret sauce of the Habitry Method is in creating a safe, supportive space for clients to talk about what they experience as they practice the habits.

>So your job, is to constantly reinforce that this group is a place where they can share all their successes and struggles. That these are the people who will help them change their habits. And that this is a place where they can talk about anything and everything. 

>You can post discussion questions that get people to reveal more about themselves so that a sense of community can develop.

>You can remind your clients about why it’s so awesome to be in your community or get them into the habit of paying attention to their thoughts and behavior. Do this by providing specific, positive feedback to individual clients or posts group whenever they do something awesome for the community, or when they practice doing the habit.

>Here’s an example post to the group that you can use to get started:
 
>Hey (Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., “Rockstars”)!

>I wanted to make a quick note to say I love all of the sharing in the introduction posts! I'm also super excited to see a couple themes keep popping up:

>1) The enthusiasm for focusing on one habit at a time (not "give me all the habits!!!").

>2) The understanding that this a COMMUNITY and that you will succeed (and struggle) TOGETHER.

>What’s your favorite part of this community so far? :)

>You also have the option of using [Habitry Daily] (http://habitry.com/daily), which is a group we created on the Habitry Coaching Platform for Habitry Coaches just like you. 

>In that group, we share:

>* One link (article, video, podcast)
>* Two open-ended questions and
>* One quote

>And we share those every day. So that you never have to think about how to get engagement from your clients ever again. To access Habitry Daily, simply access your group drawer and then tap on “Habitry Daily”.

##Week 1, Thursday AM: Introduce “Weekend Momentum Plan”

The first Habitry principle is: "Momentum trumps everything." 

Today, you'll work on getting your clients into the habit of keeping the momentum going over the weekend. The task is simple: ask your clients to post a super easy version of their habit for the weekend. 

You can use the example script below to introduce this concept.

>Hey everyone!

>When it comes to building a healthy lifestyle, only one thing matters: MOMENTUM. 

>It doesn’t matter if you’re moving ahead quickly or one step at a time, all that matters is you’re moving forward.

>So when the going gets tough, we make tough easy.

>So let's set you up to *win* this weekend.

>How? By doing an easy version of your “I will track what I eat” habit for the weekend.

>This should be so easy that it should require as much energy as brushing your teeth.

>You'll win the weekend and you’ll roll into next week with the kind of momentum you get from having rocked *your plan* last week!

>Post how you’ll track what you eat this weekend in the comments below!

##Week 1, Friday AM: Post “Weekend Momentum Plan” Check-in

Today, you'll post a thread so everyone has a second chance to share their Weekend Momentum Plan.

You can use the script below to introduce this concept.

>Hey everyone!

>If you haven’t had a chance yet, use this thread to share your Weekend Momentum Plan.

>Post how you’ll track what you eat this weekend in the comments below!

##Week 1, Saturday AM: Start weekly review discussion

One of the most valuable tools for your Habitry Group will be dedicated time every Saturday and Sunday to get your clients to reflecting on the previous week’s habit practice. This allows the people that did really well and the people that struggled to inform each other and take those lessons into the coming week. 

We recommend giving the reflection some structure such as a series of open-ended questions. 

Here are ones we’ve used:

1. What went well; what did you learn?
2. How, if at all, will you adjust the habit next week (based on your learning last week)?

Don't be afraid to let people really hash it out. Some of the most useful discussions we’ve seen started with a client saying, “I hated this!”. 

##Week 1, Sunday AM: Relax :)

Congratulations on coaching your group through their first week!

##Week 2, Monday AM: Send weekly private check-in messages

We suggest sending weekly feedback to clients every Monday morning to recap how did they did last week and get them motivated for the week ahead.

We suggest the following format:

1. Let them know that you’ll be sending them weekly check-in messages every Monday (or whatever day works for you). 

2. List the days they checked-in to do the habit. This helps them see that you’re paying personal attention to them. Optional: Add in a sentence or two that qualitatively recognizes a specific strength or behavior the client displayed, which led them in the direction of positive change. 

3. Ask them to share their big win or insight from the week. And ask them how they might adjust the habit in the upcoming week.

Here an example: 

>Hey (Client Name)! Every Monday, I’ll be sending you a private message to get your input on the past week. The idea is to give you a chance to think about how the past week went for you and if you want to adjust anything. 

>Based on your comments and taps on the checkmark, looks like you did the habit 6/7 days, which means you did the habit 1 more day than last week. The (Client Name) momentum train continues :)

>What do *you* feel was your big win or insight from last week?

>How, if at all, might you adjust your habit this week? How can we support you?

The key is to always be looking to get them to talk about a win or insight. If you need help drafting these, let me know. I’m always happy to talk. 

If clients bring up problems, ask for permission to open the discussion to their team, the group, or ask if they need a private phone call with you. Renegotiate the habit, bump up the support, make a plan, and don’t let them leave Monday without feeling 90-100% they can do this.

##Week 2, Monday AM: Tell the group how they’re succeeding

The real secret sauce of the Habitry Method is in creating a safe, supportive space for clients to talk about what they experience as they practice the habits.

So your job, is to constantly reinforce that this group is a place where they can share all their successes and struggles. That these are the people who will help them change their habits. And that this is a place where they can talk about anything and everything. 

You can post discussion questions that get people to reveal more about themselves so that a sense of community can develop. 

You can remind your clients about why it’s so awesome to be in your community or get them into the habit of paying attention to their thoughts and behavior. Do this by providing specific, positive feedback to individual clients or posts group whenever they do something awesome for the community, or when they practice doing the habit.

Here’s an example post to the group that you can use to get started:

For example:

>Hey (Insert Group Identity Label. E.g., “Rockstars”)!

>It’s week 2! 

>It’s been awesome watching each of you practice and get better at the habit.  And even better, it’s been really cool watching each of you notice how the habit is helping you personally.

>Let’s take a few minutes to keep our momentum going. Let’s “goldilocks” the habit to make sure it’s not too hard or too easy for you this week.

>Take a look at your habit statement from last week…

>Were you able to do the habit as many times as you planned? If not, how might you personalize the habit more to hit that number? 

>For example, maybe you need to pick a better trigger so you’re reminded more often to do the habit. 

>Or maybe you need to make the habit easier to do. For example, if you realized you don’t like using a food tracking app, a notepad will work just fine! Or maybe just taking a picture on your phone. 

>Share your plan for the week below! 

##Week 2, Tuesday to Thursday AM: Start a group discussion

>The real secret sauce of the Habitry Method is in creating a safe, supportive space for clients to talk about what they experience as they practice the habits.

##Week 2, Friday AM: Post “Weekend Momentum Plan” Check-in

Today, you'll post a thread so everyone has a second chance to share their Weekend Momentum Plan.

You can use the script below to introduce this concept.

>Hey everyone!

>If you haven’t had a chance yet, use this thread to share your Weekend Momentum Plan.

>Post how you’ll track what you eat this weekend in the comments below!

##Week 2, Friday AM: Select and load the next habit

You’ll need to have the next habit loaded in 48 hours before it starts. Assuming you want the next habit to start the coming Monday, that means you need to load it into the app by Friday midnight. This is to account for international time zone differences. 

You can use one of the 24 habits in the Habitry Starter Kit. Or if you want help writing something new, let me know. We have habits for everything :) Just email me and I’ll send it to you.

##Week 2, Saturday AM: Start habit review discussion

This discussion is quite similar to the discussion you posted last Saturday. Except, you’ll want your clients to talk about the entire two weeks of the habit. And you’ll also want to give them a chance to share if they want to keep doing the habit.

Here are some example questions we’ve used:

1. What, if any, was your favorite part of the last habit?
2. How, if at all, did doing the last habit help you?
3. What parts of the habit, if any, will you keep doing?

Again, don't be afraid to let people really hash it out. Some of the most useful discussions we’ve seen started with a client saying, “I hated this!”. 

##Week 2, Sunday AM: Introduce the next habit

Just like last time you introduced a habit. Post a discussion thread to start a conversation about the habit. The goal of this thread is to get clients to post their personal habit statement. In English, that means you’ll want your clients to post when and how they’ll do the habit in the coming week.

##What next?

Congratulations on coaching your group through their first habit! 

Now let’s get into what you can expect after the first habit:

1. Suggested schedule for all future habits
2. Dealing with the “Habit Hangover” 

##1. Suggested Schedule for All Future Habits

Below is a suggested posting schedule for all future habits. 

Coach tasks are highlighted in gold. Client tasks are highlighted in blue.

##2. Dealing with the “Habit Hangover”

As you head into habit 2, you will see a drop in the number of posts that clients make. This is normal, inevitable, expected, and typical. We call this dip in social engagement the “Habit Hangover”.

What’s happening? The novelty is wearing off and the habit of checking-in hasn’t formed yet. The key here is to tell clients that a drop in engagement is normal, inevitable, expected, and **a necessary part of the process of making new habits**.

We have many techniques to get clients past the Habit Hangover. We share a couple of them below. 

But first, I want to share three tips to help you get some perspective.

**1. Treat the number of responses from clients to an individual post the same way you’d advise a weight loss client to treat the number on the scale on a specific day.** It’s data that only makes sense when you look at patterns over a long time (weeks or months). The day to day fluctuations can be random.

**2. Did you know that a 0.5 to 2% engagement rate is considered REALLY GOOD?** Big name brands pay a professional to get 0.5 to 2 out of every 100 people on their Facebook pages to leave a comment. That means even if each of your clients is posting ONCE a week, you are killing it. That’s roughly a 7% engagement rate. You’re effectively destroying the biggest brands on Facebook :)

**3. Did you know that only 33% of people take their medication as prescribed by their doctor?** That’s for taking a pill for CANCER. So keep this number in mind when thinking about how your clients are doing in terms of building habits. Finally, know that the industry average for client concordance for nutrition habits is 14%. So if your clients do the habit more than 2 out of 14 days for a two week habit, they are beating the industry average!

Okay let’s talk about how to help your clients get past the Habit Hangover.

**1. Keep supporting client autonomy.** You can post a message like: 

>“Hey guys! We think reflection is the secret sauce, but it's totes optional to do it here or skip a day or two if it feels like work. In fact, if this is starting to feel like work…that’s a sign that you’re on the right track! This is a stage that everyone has to get through on the way to changing their habits :)

>So, feel free to share whatever is on your mind. You don’t have to only answer the Two Questions. If that means you want to say, ‘Hey guys, today sucked’, you can! We are here to support you no matter what. You get to decide how you want to use the group every day. Don't make it a homework assignment and try to keep it daily!”

**2. Keep posting fun threads.**​ Use [Habitry Daily] (http://habitry.com/daily). Post more baby animals, jokes, and content about the community itself. You need to create more novelty, and it's totally fine if it's way off topic. If you're bored, then they were bored a week ago. Do things you think are fun. Do the things you want to do and talk about the things you want to talk about, and I bet they'll have fun too — because they were drawn to you for a reason. Supplement what you’re doing with lots of open-­ended questions to see how they are liking it.
