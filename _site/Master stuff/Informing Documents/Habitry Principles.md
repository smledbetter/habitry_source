# Habitry Principles
As this project has continued, Habitry Coaches keep learning, tweaking, and changing the system, but some common principles have emereged. The rest of this tutorial will cover many details, but if any of them confuse you these principles are where to look for guidance.

## Momentum trumps everything.

Coach Stevo noted that most clients do not know what they want, they just don't to be where they are anymore. He calls his job, "getting people from Point A to Point 'Not A'." So like an airplane in a dogfight, the most important quality for success is maintaining momentum. Get them moving. Keep them moving. Your only enemies are inertia and friction.

## We only track one.

From Coach Stevo:
The thing about short-term goal setting (any habit that you haven't mastered yet is just a really well-defined short-term goal), is that having lots of them not only doesn't help anything, it's pointless and often makes things harder than they need to be. In 1000+ clients, I have rarely seen a failure of willpower but I have seen 10,000 failures of focus.

Shah, Friedman, and Kruglanski (2002) showed that people with multiple goals only concentrate on one goal anyway. Gilliland and Landis (1992) showed that we tend to concentrate on whatever goal is the most clearly defined. And Fishbach, Friedman, and Kruglanski (2003) found that temptation makes us immediately start to prioritize our short-term goals (and then default to the one that's the most clearly defined). So once the rubber meets the road and your clients are out there and tempted by anything and everything, they're gonna be defaulting to one goal anyway. Now what do I mean by "clearly-defined?"

According to the goal-setting meta-analysis of Webb and Sheeran (2006) and all the fine work of Wendy Wood and David Neal, it's better to work smarter, not harder in the pursuit of desired behavior. And smarter means habit-formation. And since habit means trigger, action, reward, we need to clearly define those right into the goal itself (more on that later).

Then we track it. We track that one goal and only that goal. I give them feedback on that one goal. We talk about that one goal. We reflect on that one goal. Funnily enough they might notice they are getting better at a lot of things at the same time, but it's because we're staying focused. A client who has lots of short-term goals is often just operating in a feedback vacuum. They're judging themselves on getting good at everything all at once because their attention is getting pulled all over the place and all they see is failure. What they need instead is feedback that they're improving on anything. They need proof they're mastering something.

So pick one well-defined, habit-based goal. Track it. And give your client feedback on it and only it. Yes, it's hard. They're going to want to do all the things. They're going to want your permission to do all the things and they are going to think that doing all the things is what you want from them. But as coaches, we have to model the patience and focus we want them to learn. They'll push you. But you only have to say one thing:

_We only track one._

## Teach self-awareness.

The real goal of a Habitry Coach should be to get clients to learn their own way forward. This is why so much emphasis is placed on the two reflection questions. In fact, since reflection is the only thing that is actually repeated often enough to really become habit, it's habit that we're actually trying to cultivate.

## Create the social conditions of success.

Habit-formation is as much an art as it is a science. We’ve known for a very long time that habits aren’t the only neurological game in town. You can’t explain all the richness of human thinking as either being all unconscious and automatic (like a robot) or all conscious and deliberative (like a pondering philosopher). But we’ve been researching both of these explanations for the way people think separately for generations (Dolan & Dayan, 2013). It’s not been until quite recently that have researchers have been combining the observations of these two ways of thinking into a single working theory (Wood, Labrecque, Lin, & Runger, 2014). A “dual-process theory” that takes into account both nonautomatic and automatic thinking. Both the conscious and unconscious. Both deciding, planning, then executing on a desire to eat popcorn; and mindlessly shoving stale kernels into your face (Neal, Wood, & Quinn, 2006).

“Dual-Process” means there are two ways that the brain can perform any part of any action: either consciously or unconsciously. You can look down at the keyboard and think very hard about deliberately spelling out each word letter by letter, or you can look ahead at the screen and type by touch at 100 words per minute. But if you think about the process of typing, it’s not that simple is it? Sometimes you need to look down to see what you’re typing. Sometimes you need to think really hard about how a word is spelled and look at the keyboard to find the letters. Sometimes you’re exhausted and hangry and you totally forget where the damn “X” is for like 2 whole minutes. And if you’re typing on a Dvorak keyboard, you might as well be learning from scratch.

The important thing to know about the dual-process theory, as we hope we’ve shown with the typing example, is that there is very little that is pure habit or purely planned. Everything we engage in lies on a spectrum that is constantly changing based on our contexts, goals, available willpower, and a myriad of other factors. We can eat lots of colorful vegetables for months without really trying, then one day notice that you haven't eaten a green thing all week. Young parents often watch every cleaning and personal hygiene habit they’ve developed over their adult lives crumble in the wake of a few dozen sleepless nights. The point we're trying to make is that the stuff we call “healthy habits” are always going to be context specific and subject to change. They might even appear fickle. So you need to be real with your clients about just what it is you’re trying to accomplish and just what the journey is going to look like. The goal isn’t to make target behaviors effortless, but easier. And the journey will not be a straight line, but rather a winding series of experiments to learn what we need to do to make those target behaviors a little bit easier every day.

So the most important thing to know about habit-formation, is that if we want to deliberately form new habits, we have to use a completely different mental process. We have to ponder, plan, and prepare. We have to rely on some motivation and spend our willpower wisely. We have to set some goals and we have to learn a heaping dose of self-awareness. And we have to help them mold their own environment in which those habits will form through fostering their Self-Determined Motivation.

## Nothing is required.

Promoting Self-Determined Motivation is simple: just don't thwart people's Basic Psychological Needs. That means going out of our way to create a safe space that rewards people's feelings of Autonomy, Competence, and Belonging. Chief amoung these is rewarding autonomy, which in social psychology means, "the feeling that one is acting in accordance with one's own values in order to become the best version of one's self." In action, this means treating clients like adults. There is a huge differece between creating the conditions in which someone feels invested and responsible for one's own actions, and an environment where one feels controlled. So take every action you can to remind people that they have choices, even when those choices are not obvious.


## The path will emerge.

Every group, every cohort, every team, every collection of human beings is different. And even when eveyrone has the same problems, not everyone will need the same solutions. From the outside, for most coaches Habitry means _chaos._ We let most things be. We don't direct or cajole people to stay on a predefined path, we simply guide the group in the direction that maintains the most momentum over the long haul. That path is not drawn. It has to emerge. In practice, that means listening to the group to find out what it needs, and never really planning to far ahead.

## The clients are the experts in “how.” The coach is the expert in “what.”

Perhaps the most important principle to keep in mind during daily interaction, this is a hard one for most coaches because we mistakenly think that the value that clients see in us is that we "know everything." And while it's true that we are the ones thay generally know what people need to be doing, they are the ones who are living it. They are the ones who are looking at things every day and thinking, "how can I make this a part of my life?" Now multiply that experience out for everyone in the cohort, and you've got a hell of a lot of knowledge about _how_ to integrate _what_ you are telling them to do.
